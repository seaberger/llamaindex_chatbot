PowerMax-Pro – Fast Response (µs) Pyroelectric – Pulse Energy MeasurementCoherent developed PowerMax-Pro technology (Patent #9,012,848) to meet  the growing need for a laser power sensor that offers the broad wavelength  sensitivity, large dynamic range and high damage resistance of a thermopile,  together with the fast response speed approaching that of a semiconductor  photodiode.  The PowerMax-Pro is constructed and configured differently than a thermopile.  Specifically, in this device the heat flows vertically through the detector, and  the electrical field that is generated moves perpendicular to the heat flow. The  materials used in this sensor are a stack of films which have layer thicknesses  on the order of microns. Incident laser light is absorbed and generates heat  which is able to flow very quickly through these thin layers to the heat sink  below the detector where it is dissipated. The electrical signal from the thin film  layers moves laterally to the edges of the device where it can be measured by  tapping into the sensor electrodes.  In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has a sensing time  Coherent energy sensors use a pyroelectric element to measure the energy in a  laser pulse. It does this by producing a large electrical charge for a small change  in temperature. The active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor  element and converts it to a voltage that can be measured by a peak detector  circuit or a Coherent meter. Pyroelectrics can only be used with pulsed lasers. Pyroelectric sensors are ideal for measuring the output of pulsed lasers. These  devices can be used at repetition rates to 10 kHz and beyond, and can be used  to measure laser pulses beyond a Joule.PowerMax-Pro - Laser Power Sensors constant value of several seconds, the time constant for the thin film configuration is in the microsecond range. This enables the  sensor to provide an essentially instant power measurement without any overshoot and also enables pulse analysis of modulated  lasers with pulses greater than 10 microseconds.

The photodiodes used in these types of sensors  offer high sensitivity and low noise, enabling them to detect very low light  levels. Attenuating filters must be used when operating above the milliwatt level  because they saturate above approximately 1 W/cm2.  Photodiodes are also convenient for tuning and peaking lasers due to  their fast response time. The spectral range is more limited than our other  sensor technologies. These devices are also referred to as optical sensors.   Semiconductor/optical sensors are limited to measuring CW laser power.Semiconductor/OpticalSensor TechnologiesPower and Energy Measurement Solutions Thermopile sensors are a great all-purpose technology suitable for many lasers.  They are used for measuring CW  laser power, average power in pulsed lasers,  and are often used to integrate the energy of long pulses. Thermopile sensors absorb incident laser radiation and convert it into heat.  This heat ultimately flows to a heat sink that is held at ambient temperature  by either convection-cooling or water-cooling. The temperature difference  between the absorber and the heat sink is converted into an electrical signal by  a thermocouple junction.  Thermopiles operate across a wide range of input powers, and unlike a  semiconductor sensor they will not saturate. The spectral range is dependent  upon the coating applied to absorb the laser energy. The coating used on many  thermopiles is broadband in nature and is relatively flat from the ultraviolet  through the infrared. These sensors have natural response times on the order  of several seconds for a low power sensor and up to one minute for a kilowatt  sensor. When combined with a Coherent meter a speed-up algorithm provides  a much faster response – on the order of seconds for most sensors.  Position Sensing Function  Coherent has two lines of thermopile sensors. The “LM Model” line utilizes  a unique thermopile disk in which the thermocouples are split into four  quadrants, allowing the sensors to provide beam position information in  addition to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates traditional  thermopile disks that provide power measurement. Position sensing feature is available from 30 mW   to 5 kW with resolution of 10 to 100 µm.

This power meter combines the  power and versatility of the LabMax, with two new higher speed  sampling modes when used with PowerMax-Pro technology.  High speed mode increases the continuous sampling rate to   20 kHz, enabling analysis of laser pulse trains common in  medical and microwelding applications. Snapshot mode provides  burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz, enabling users to view and  analyze the temporal pulse trace of modulated lasers common in  various commercial cutting, engraving and drilling applications. In the traditional 10 Hz sampling mode, PowerMax-Pro sensors  provide an instant power reading, much like a photodiode but at  very high powers. Legacy thermopiles are also compatible with  the 10 Hz sampling mode, just like in past meters. The product includes a new Windows-based PC application that  enables a wide range of analysis functions including statistics  and histogram, trending, tuning, data logging, as well as a new  ability to zoom in on detailed pulse shapes and pulse bursts  using PowerMax-Pro technology. The software interface allows  for flexible sizing of informational panes within the application,  in which contents are auto-sized dynamically as the panes are  adjusted, allowing the user to size the information of greatest  importance. Data is analyzed on the PC through USB or RS-232 interfaces  through the Windows PC application, or directly through host  commands. Since the LabMax-Pro interfaces via USB and utilizes  Windows, the LabMax-Pro can be interfaced to tablets that  operate on the Windows 8 platform. This unique capability   gives users flexibility to display data and allow state-of-the-art  color and touch screen displays.In addition to PC interfacing, LabMax-Pro SSIM also includes an  analog output with user-selectable voltages of 0 to 1V, 2V, or 4V.  Triggering can be achieved with an external trigger input or an  internal trigger that is user adjustable. The meter is configured as a module for direct PC control and  is compatible with PM model thermopiles and PowerMax-Pro  sensors.  A sensor is just part of a measurement system, and can only  deliver high quality data if it is matched with electronics to  properly acquire, condition and process the raw signal from  the sensor. Coherent has developed the LabMax-Pro SSIM  laser power meter specifically to fully capitalize on the inherent  capabilities of PowerMax-Pro sensors.   To minimize user cost and maximize flexibility, the LabMax-Pro  is packaged as a Smart Sensor Interface Module (SSIM) that  interfaces with a host computer through either USB or   RS-232. LabMax-Pro PC, a new Windows PC application, then  enables instrument control and displays measurement results,  including laser tuning and pulse shape visualization, on a host  computer. The software also performs a wide range  LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter LabMax-Pro SSIM   Laser Measurement System Power & Energy Meters', 'page_label: 13 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  11 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter of analysis functions such as live statistics, histograms, trending  and data logging. In addition, a complete set of host commands  can be sent through either the USB or RS-232 interface which is  particularly useful for embedded applications. High Speed Sampling for Pulse Visualization The standard operating mode of the LabMax-Pro SSIM utilizes  a typical 10 Hz sampling rate. At this data rate, it allows  PowerMax-Pro sensors to provide an instant power reading,  much like a photodiode, but, of course, taking advantage of the  sensor’s ability to directly read very high powers. High volume  processes that use high repetition rate or quasi-CW lasers, such  as picosecond and femtosecond lasers, can benefit significantly  from fast power measurements. Time currently spent monitoring  the process with thermopiles can be spent processing parts,  and with such rapid measurements, the process can be  monitored more frequently. Instead of spending up to a minute  or more taking a reading, the measurement can be performed  in less than a second with PowerMax-Pro technology, enabling  throughput improvement with very little engineering investment.  The standard operating mode is best used to measure the power  of CW lasers, or the average power of high repetition rates  lasers. Two High Speed sampling modes have been implemented  in the meter electronics and software to fully exploit the rapid  response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors for measuring  modulated lasers operating between these two extremes. These  modes enable advanced analysis of high power, modulated  lasers in a way that has never been possible before. The first High Speed mode utilizes a continuous data sampling  rate of 20 kHz, allowing pulse shape analysis of modulated lasers  with repetition rates of up to 2 kHz. These types of pulse trains  are common in many laser-based medical treatments and some  materials processing applications such as micro welding. The second High Speed mode is called “Snapshot Mode,” which  provides burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz for a period of time  up to 384 milliseconds. This is fast enough to enable visualization  of the pulse shape of the modulated lasers common in various  commercial cutting, engraving and drilling applications, as  well as long pulses and pulse trains used in aesthetic medical  applications. This type of temporal visualization offers new  insight into the true performance of the laser previously masked  by slow thermopiles. This new informationIt provides developers  with more repeatable methods to transfer processes from  engineering to manufacturing and to control and monitor the  process once it’s up and running. Many thermal-based materials  processing applications can be better controlled with this  information, leading to faster processing with higher yield; at  the same time, the quality of laser produced features can be  enhanced.

Similar to  other Coherent USB and RS sensors, this configuration offers  a smaller form factor for use inside laser processing systems  or production lines. Additionally, the cost of annual calibration  is half that of a separate meter and sensor system. The  PowerMax-Pro USB and RS sensors operate with LabMax-Pro  PC applications software (included). PowerMax-Pro (Patent #9,012,848) represents a dramatic  technological advancement in laser power sensing that utilizes  a thin-film detector only microns thick which rapidly senses  thermal changes due to incident laser energy. The result is   a measurement response time below 10 μs, as compared to   over 1 second for traditional thermopiles. These detectors   can operate at high power over a spectral range as broad as  355 nm to 11 μm, and incorporate a large 30 mm x 30 mm  active area. The high response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors is  particularly advantageous in a wide range of commercial   and medical applications. It enables nearly instant  measurement of CW laser power, resulting in increased  throughput, and also supports high resolution analysis of  modulated laser pulse shapes resulting in improved laser  characterization and process control.Features • Enhance productivity and quality while improving   measurement speed • Measures power in tens of microseconds • High power up to 150 W • Supports lasers from UV to Far-IR wavelengths • Capable of tracing the individual pulse shape of modulated   and long pulse lasers • Large 30 x 30 mm active area • LabMax-Pro meter provides high speed sampling for    best compatibilityPowerMax-Pro 150F HD and   PowerMax-Pro 150 HDPower (W) 0123456 0 Time (sec)51 01 52 02 53 0PowerMax-Pr o Thermopil e PowerMax-Pro SensorsPowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors Product Overview', 'page_label: 27 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  25 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727PowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors Product Overview The following figures demonstrates PowerMax-Pro high speed analysis feature being used to track the power output of an   RF-modulated CO 2 laser from the time the laser is first turned on until the laser stabilizes:A dramatic technological advancement from Coherent has   yielded a completely new type of fast response power detector.  The high response speed is particularly advan-tageous in  commercial applications where it enables CW laser power to be  sampled faster and more frequently; with modulated sources it  delivers peak power and temporal pulse shape data, from which  pulse energy can be integrated. This real-time feedback can be  used to improve laser system throughput and quality, and to  improve process precision, with minimal engineering investment. In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has  a sensing time constant value of several seconds, the time  constant for PowerMax-Pro is in the microsecond range. This enables the sensor to provide an essentially instant power  measurement (Figure 1). The PowerMax-Pro sensor preserves  the main benefits of the traditional thermopile architecture,  namely large active area (30 mm x 30 mm), wide dynamic range  (50 mW to 150W), high damage resistance (14 kW/cm2) and  broad wavelength range (300 nm to 11 μm). The response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors allows users  to move beyond just measuring average power, and enables  analysis of the temporal pulse shape and peak power of  modulated lasers with pulse lengths greater than 10 μs. These  pulses can then be integrated to calculate individual pulse  energy.

At 3 kW the top front portion of the enclosure will reach    83°C in approximately 1000 seconds (at 2 kW average power the enclosure will reach 61°C at 1000 seconds and at 1 kW the enclosure reaches 51°C at 1000 seconds). 2 The sensor can be used above 3 kW intermittently for up to 200 to 400 seconds with increasingly larger beams. 3 With a 20 mm diameter beam, this sensor can be used safely with modulated sources with peak powers up to 5 kW and pulse lengths up to 100 milliseconds. 4 If care is taken to increase the beam size to 25 mm, the sensor could be used with modulated peak power up to 7 kW for 100 milliseconds. 5 These curves are for Gaussian beam profiles. Flatter beams can handle higher powers (~5%) for longer lengths of time, and beams with hot spots or “super Gaussian” beams the curves must be de-rated by up to 30%.    Contacting Coherent LMC applications engineering for more detailed information.This chart indicates the maximum average power the sensor can  handle based upon beam diameter.This chart can be used to determine intermittent power handling   capability at powers above 3 kW.

Thermopiles  are also capable of integrating long pulse widths. This allows the  thermopile to measure the energy of single pulses between 1  millisecond and 10 seconds in length, and with energies from  millijoules to hundreds of Joules. Long-pulse measurement is  only possible when the thermopiles are used in conjunction  with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP, LabMax-TO, or FieldMaxII-TOP  meters, or when using a PowerMax-USB/RS sensor. This ability to integrate relatively long laser pulses with a  thermopile is necessary when the laser pulse width exceeds the  maximum pulse width rating of pyroelectric sensors. Pyroelectric  sensors are typically limited to maximum pulse widths in the  millisecond range. When the pulse width exceeds milliseconds, a  thermopile is a good solution.   A good “rule of thumb” for using a thermopile for this type of  measurement is to compare the maximum pulse energy you  need to measure with the maximum power rating of a sensor  (maximum power ratings can be found in the Power Sensor Summary Specifications on pages 53 to 54 or in the detailed  product specifications contained on each product page). Common applications for this type of measurement are in the  medical field, especially skin resurfacing and hair removal, and  in material processing applications such as laser welding. These  laser systems often utilize high-energy diode lasers that have  large beam sizes and relatively long pulses. A detector like the  PM150-50C is ideal for these measurements.  It features a large  50 mm aperture size, can handle pulse energies up to 150J, and  can be used air-cooled for single pulse energy measurements (a  PM150-50C will normally need to be water-cooled for continuous  power measurements). Using a LabMax power/energy meter, or a PowerMax-USB/RS  sensor, expands the range of long-pulse Joule measurements  down into the low millijoule level when used with thermopiles  such as the PS10, PS10Q, PS19, and PS19Q sensors. Long-pulse measurements are limited to single pulses in order  to achieve the most accurate measurements.PM10-19C, PM150-50C and PM150-50XC Power Sensors', 'page_label: 52 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  50 Superior Reliability & Performance                 •                 www.coherent.com                 •                 LMC.sales@coherent.com Product OverviewPowerMax Sensors Introduction Coherent PowerMax-USB sensors provide plug-and-play   laser power measurement directly on a PC without the need  for additional electronic instrumentation. The measurement  circuitry typically found in a standalone meter has been reduced  in size to the extent that it can now fit inside a USB connector.  The circuitry and USB connector have been adapted into a  ‘PowerMax-USB’ cable that can be integrated to most Coherent  power sensors providing accurate power measurements of all  types of CW and pulsed sources from the UV to Far IR.  This measurement platform can also be used to measure   the energy in a long laser pulse (typically greater than   1 millisecond in pulse width) by integrating the output of a  thermopile sensor. The PowerMax-RS sensors incorporate the same circuitry inside  an RS-232 connector to provide a convenient platform for  integrating power measurement inside laser processing systems  that often incorporate RS-232 inputs instead of USB.Features • PowerMax-USB provides direct USB 2.0 connection to PC.

The   “LM Model” line utilizes a unique thermopile disk in which   the thermocouples are split into four quadrants, allowing   the sensors to provide beam position information in addition   to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates   traditional thermopile disks that provide power measurement  without beam position information. Both types of sensors can   be used with the PowerMax-USB and PowerMax-RS sensors.

The combined accuracy is based upon practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards Guidelines for Evaluating and  Expressing Uncertainty (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition). The combined accuracy of the measurement is calculated by using  the law of propagation of uncertainty using the “root-sum-of-square” (square root of the sum of squares), sometimes described as  “summing in quadrature” where: Absorption (%) 0.800.850.900.951.01.051.1 0.1 Wavelength (µm)11 0Black Coating w/Quartz WindowBlack Coating Broadband Coating UV CoatingCoherent uses three primary coatings to capture the incident radiation on our thermal sensors.

These sensors are ideal for measuring laser diodes, HeNe lasers, and small ion  lasers. The PS10 model includes a light tube mounted to the front of the housing,  which minimizes the effects of background radiation. The light tube can be removed  and replaced by FC or SMA fiber connectors (see Accessories - page 93). Where  optimum stability is required, specify the PS10Q or PS19Q, which include a wedged  quartz window for applications from 0.3 to 2.0 μm. The quartz window more  effectively eliminates thermal background radiation and the effects of air currents.

Where optimum stability   is required, specify the PS19Q, which include a wedged quartz window for applications from 0.3 to 2.1 μm. The quartz window more effectively eliminates thermal background radiation and the effects of air currents.Features • Direct USB Interface • Thermally stabilized design for low power sensitivity • Spectrally\\tflat;\\tgood\\tfor\\tbroadband\\tlight\\tsources • PC Application software includedPower Range 100 µW to 1 W PS10 and PS19Q 1 Power stability over 30 minutes in typical lab environment. 2 Software and post stand included.3 190 nm to 300 nm operation restricted to <100 mW average power and <250 W/cm2 power density. ** 1 Day Ship program: eligible for next business day shipment.

The mea - sureable power varies significantly by wavelength. See the chart on the next page.  Spectrally calibrated filters are used to attenuate the laser beam, thus allowing  for a higher average power measurement than is typically possible with a photo - diode. They work with CW (continuous wave) as well as pulsed sources greater  than 100 pps. The standard UV/VIS has a removable nose cone that can be used  to reduce stray light, which is helpful when measuring on the low end of the  power range, and the Wand UV/VIS incorporates a thin profile metal enclosure to  fit into tight locations. See page 93  for Wand sensor fiber adapters.

Because the spectral response  of the filter and photodiode varies significantly  across this wavelength range it is important to  check the maximum measureable power at the  wavelength of use to make sure the sensor is not  being saturated. This curve plots the maximum measurable power,  which is the saturation level of the photodiode, as  well as the minimum recommended power level,  by wavelength.  Angular Sensitivity The following curves plot the sensitivity to incident angle, and numerical aperture in the case of non-collimated beams.PowerMax - Laser Power Sensors Measurement Linearity Like all silicon photodiodes, the UV/VIS Quantum sensor has  temperature sensitivity in the infrared region.  At 1064 nm, for example, it has a 0.5%/ºC thermal coefficient.   Measurement error of up to 2% are present at 1064 nm after a  10 minute warm-up time due to the electronics inside the sen- sor, and additional error can be present if the ambient measure- ment environment differs from the calibration wavelength listed  on the calibration certificate. In practice, wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm have insignificant  effects due to temperature. See the chart at left to reference the thermal coefficient at the  wavelength of use.Saturation and Minimum Power   UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength Angular Dependence Numerical Aperture Dependence Photo Sensitivity Temperature CharacteristicWavelength (nm)Saturation and Minimum Powe r UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength Power (mW)  0.001 01 2001000 0.010.1110100 2004 00 6008 00 1000Wand UV -VIS Saturation Power Wand UV -VIS Minimum Power Standard UV -VIS Saturation Power Standard UV -VIS Minimum Power Incident Angle (degrees)Angular Dependence   Relative Sensitivity 0.8 02 51.0 0.850.90.95 51 01 52 0 Numerical ApertureNumerical Aperture Dependence   Relative Sensitivity 0.85 00 .61.0 0.90.95 0.10 .2 0.30 .4 0.5 Power Sensors', 'page_label: 63 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  61 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727 Features • Convective air-cooled • Spectrally\\tflat\\tfrom\\t0.19\\tμm\\tto\\t11\\tμm • 1 to 10 mW resolution • 19 mm aperture  • Compatible with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP/TO, FieldMaxII,    and FieldMate meters PM2, PM10 and PM30 Model PM2 PM10 PM30 Wavelength Range (µm)  0.25 to 11 Power Range 10 mW to 2 W 10 mW to 10 W 100 mW to 30 W Long-Pulse Joules Range (J) 0.5 to 2 0.5 to 10 0.5 to 50 Maximum Intermittent Power (<5 min.)

A volume-absorbing substrate mounted in front of  the detector absorbs the bulk of the laser energy rather than all of the energy  striking the front surface of the detector element. This results in a much higher  damage threshold, approaching 2 J/cm 2, at relatively low repetition rates of  approximately 10 pps. A removable front aperture allows easy replacement of  the volume-absorbing substrate should it be damaged (replacement absorbers  may be ordered using part number 0011-8935, PMV1-KIT).

PowerMax-Pro – Fast Response (µs) Pyroelectric – Pulse Energy MeasurementCoherent developed PowerMax-Pro technology (Patent #9,012,848) to meet  the growing need for a laser power sensor that offers the broad wavelength  sensitivity, large dynamic range and high damage resistance of a thermopile,  together with the fast response speed approaching that of a semiconductor  photodiode.  The PowerMax-Pro is constructed and configured differently than a thermopile.  Specifically, in this device the heat flows vertically through the detector, and  the electrical field that is generated moves perpendicular to the heat flow. The  materials used in this sensor are a stack of films which have layer thicknesses  on the order of microns. Incident laser light is absorbed and generates heat  which is able to flow very quickly through these thin layers to the heat sink  below the detector where it is dissipated. The electrical signal from the thin film  layers moves laterally to the edges of the device where it can be measured by  tapping into the sensor electrodes.  In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has a sensing time  Coherent energy sensors use a pyroelectric element to measure the energy in a  laser pulse. It does this by producing a large electrical charge for a small change  in temperature. The active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor  element and converts it to a voltage that can be measured by a peak detector  circuit or a Coherent meter. Pyroelectrics can only be used with pulsed lasers. Pyroelectric sensors are ideal for measuring the output of pulsed lasers. These  devices can be used at repetition rates to 10 kHz and beyond, and can be used  to measure laser pulses beyond a Joule.PowerMax-Pro - Laser Power Sensors constant value of several seconds, the time constant for the thin film configuration is in the microsecond range. This enables the  sensor to provide an essentially instant power measurement without any overshoot and also enables pulse analysis of modulated  lasers with pulses greater than 10 microseconds.

The photodiodes used in these types of sensors  offer high sensitivity and low noise, enabling them to detect very low light  levels. Attenuating filters must be used when operating above the milliwatt level  because they saturate above approximately 1 W/cm2.  Photodiodes are also convenient for tuning and peaking lasers due to  their fast response time. The spectral range is more limited than our other  sensor technologies. These devices are also referred to as optical sensors.   Semiconductor/optical sensors are limited to measuring CW laser power.Semiconductor/OpticalSensor TechnologiesPower and Energy Measurement Solutions Thermopile sensors are a great all-purpose technology suitable for many lasers.  They are used for measuring CW  laser power, average power in pulsed lasers,  and are often used to integrate the energy of long pulses. Thermopile sensors absorb incident laser radiation and convert it into heat.  This heat ultimately flows to a heat sink that is held at ambient temperature  by either convection-cooling or water-cooling. The temperature difference  between the absorber and the heat sink is converted into an electrical signal by  a thermocouple junction.  Thermopiles operate across a wide range of input powers, and unlike a  semiconductor sensor they will not saturate. The spectral range is dependent  upon the coating applied to absorb the laser energy. The coating used on many  thermopiles is broadband in nature and is relatively flat from the ultraviolet  through the infrared. These sensors have natural response times on the order  of several seconds for a low power sensor and up to one minute for a kilowatt  sensor. When combined with a Coherent meter a speed-up algorithm provides  a much faster response – on the order of seconds for most sensors.  Position Sensing Function  Coherent has two lines of thermopile sensors. The “LM Model” line utilizes  a unique thermopile disk in which the thermocouples are split into four  quadrants, allowing the sensors to provide beam position information in  addition to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates traditional  thermopile disks that provide power measurement. Position sensing feature is available from 30 mW   to 5 kW with resolution of 10 to 100 µm.

This power meter combines the  power and versatility of the LabMax, with two new higher speed  sampling modes when used with PowerMax-Pro technology.  High speed mode increases the continuous sampling rate to   20 kHz, enabling analysis of laser pulse trains common in  medical and microwelding applications. Snapshot mode provides  burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz, enabling users to view and  analyze the temporal pulse trace of modulated lasers common in  various commercial cutting, engraving and drilling applications. In the traditional 10 Hz sampling mode, PowerMax-Pro sensors  provide an instant power reading, much like a photodiode but at  very high powers. Legacy thermopiles are also compatible with  the 10 Hz sampling mode, just like in past meters. The product includes a new Windows-based PC application that  enables a wide range of analysis functions including statistics  and histogram, trending, tuning, data logging, as well as a new  ability to zoom in on detailed pulse shapes and pulse bursts  using PowerMax-Pro technology. The software interface allows  for flexible sizing of informational panes within the application,  in which contents are auto-sized dynamically as the panes are  adjusted, allowing the user to size the information of greatest  importance. Data is analyzed on the PC through USB or RS-232 interfaces  through the Windows PC application, or directly through host  commands. Since the LabMax-Pro interfaces via USB and utilizes  Windows, the LabMax-Pro can be interfaced to tablets that  operate on the Windows 8 platform. This unique capability   gives users flexibility to display data and allow state-of-the-art  color and touch screen displays.In addition to PC interfacing, LabMax-Pro SSIM also includes an  analog output with user-selectable voltages of 0 to 1V, 2V, or 4V.  Triggering can be achieved with an external trigger input or an  internal trigger that is user adjustable. The meter is configured as a module for direct PC control and  is compatible with PM model thermopiles and PowerMax-Pro  sensors.  A sensor is just part of a measurement system, and can only  deliver high quality data if it is matched with electronics to  properly acquire, condition and process the raw signal from  the sensor. Coherent has developed the LabMax-Pro SSIM  laser power meter specifically to fully capitalize on the inherent  capabilities of PowerMax-Pro sensors.   To minimize user cost and maximize flexibility, the LabMax-Pro  is packaged as a Smart Sensor Interface Module (SSIM) that  interfaces with a host computer through either USB or   RS-232. LabMax-Pro PC, a new Windows PC application, then  enables instrument control and displays measurement results,  including laser tuning and pulse shape visualization, on a host  computer. The software also performs a wide range  LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter LabMax-Pro SSIM   Laser Measurement System Power & Energy Meters', 'page_label: 13 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  11 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter of analysis functions such as live statistics, histograms, trending  and data logging. In addition, a complete set of host commands  can be sent through either the USB or RS-232 interface which is  particularly useful for embedded applications. High Speed Sampling for Pulse Visualization The standard operating mode of the LabMax-Pro SSIM utilizes  a typical 10 Hz sampling rate. At this data rate, it allows  PowerMax-Pro sensors to provide an instant power reading,  much like a photodiode, but, of course, taking advantage of the  sensor’s ability to directly read very high powers. High volume  processes that use high repetition rate or quasi-CW lasers, such  as picosecond and femtosecond lasers, can benefit significantly  from fast power measurements. Time currently spent monitoring  the process with thermopiles can be spent processing parts,  and with such rapid measurements, the process can be  monitored more frequently. Instead of spending up to a minute  or more taking a reading, the measurement can be performed  in less than a second with PowerMax-Pro technology, enabling  throughput improvement with very little engineering investment.  The standard operating mode is best used to measure the power  of CW lasers, or the average power of high repetition rates  lasers. Two High Speed sampling modes have been implemented  in the meter electronics and software to fully exploit the rapid  response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors for measuring  modulated lasers operating between these two extremes. These  modes enable advanced analysis of high power, modulated  lasers in a way that has never been possible before. The first High Speed mode utilizes a continuous data sampling  rate of 20 kHz, allowing pulse shape analysis of modulated lasers  with repetition rates of up to 2 kHz. These types of pulse trains  are common in many laser-based medical treatments and some  materials processing applications such as micro welding. The second High Speed mode is called “Snapshot Mode,” which  provides burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz for a period of time  up to 384 milliseconds. This is fast enough to enable visualization  of the pulse shape of the modulated lasers common in various  commercial cutting, engraving and drilling applications, as  well as long pulses and pulse trains used in aesthetic medical  applications. This type of temporal visualization offers new  insight into the true performance of the laser previously masked  by slow thermopiles. This new informationIt provides developers  with more repeatable methods to transfer processes from  engineering to manufacturing and to control and monitor the  process once it’s up and running. Many thermal-based materials  processing applications can be better controlled with this  information, leading to faster processing with higher yield; at  the same time, the quality of laser produced features can be  enhanced.

Similar to  other Coherent USB and RS sensors, this configuration offers  a smaller form factor for use inside laser processing systems  or production lines. Additionally, the cost of annual calibration  is half that of a separate meter and sensor system. The  PowerMax-Pro USB and RS sensors operate with LabMax-Pro  PC applications software (included). PowerMax-Pro (Patent #9,012,848) represents a dramatic  technological advancement in laser power sensing that utilizes  a thin-film detector only microns thick which rapidly senses  thermal changes due to incident laser energy. The result is   a measurement response time below 10 μs, as compared to   over 1 second for traditional thermopiles. These detectors   can operate at high power over a spectral range as broad as  355 nm to 11 μm, and incorporate a large 30 mm x 30 mm  active area. The high response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors is  particularly advantageous in a wide range of commercial   and medical applications. It enables nearly instant  measurement of CW laser power, resulting in increased  throughput, and also supports high resolution analysis of  modulated laser pulse shapes resulting in improved laser  characterization and process control.Features • Enhance productivity and quality while improving   measurement speed • Measures power in tens of microseconds • High power up to 150 W • Supports lasers from UV to Far-IR wavelengths • Capable of tracing the individual pulse shape of modulated   and long pulse lasers • Large 30 x 30 mm active area • LabMax-Pro meter provides high speed sampling for    best compatibilityPowerMax-Pro 150F HD and   PowerMax-Pro 150 HDPower (W) 0123456 0 Time (sec)51 01 52 02 53 0PowerMax-Pr o Thermopil e PowerMax-Pro SensorsPowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors Product Overview', 'page_label: 27 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  25 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727PowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors Product Overview The following figures demonstrates PowerMax-Pro high speed analysis feature being used to track the power output of an   RF-modulated CO 2 laser from the time the laser is first turned on until the laser stabilizes:A dramatic technological advancement from Coherent has   yielded a completely new type of fast response power detector.  The high response speed is particularly advan-tageous in  commercial applications where it enables CW laser power to be  sampled faster and more frequently; with modulated sources it  delivers peak power and temporal pulse shape data, from which  pulse energy can be integrated. This real-time feedback can be  used to improve laser system throughput and quality, and to  improve process precision, with minimal engineering investment. In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has  a sensing time constant value of several seconds, the time  constant for PowerMax-Pro is in the microsecond range. This enables the sensor to provide an essentially instant power  measurement (Figure 1). The PowerMax-Pro sensor preserves  the main benefits of the traditional thermopile architecture,  namely large active area (30 mm x 30 mm), wide dynamic range  (50 mW to 150W), high damage resistance (14 kW/cm2) and  broad wavelength range (300 nm to 11 μm). The response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors allows users  to move beyond just measuring average power, and enables  analysis of the temporal pulse shape and peak power of  modulated lasers with pulse lengths greater than 10 μs. These  pulses can then be integrated to calculate individual pulse  energy.

At 3 kW the top front portion of the enclosure will reach    83°C in approximately 1000 seconds (at 2 kW average power the enclosure will reach 61°C at 1000 seconds and at 1 kW the enclosure reaches 51°C at 1000 seconds). 2 The sensor can be used above 3 kW intermittently for up to 200 to 400 seconds with increasingly larger beams. 3 With a 20 mm diameter beam, this sensor can be used safely with modulated sources with peak powers up to 5 kW and pulse lengths up to 100 milliseconds. 4 If care is taken to increase the beam size to 25 mm, the sensor could be used with modulated peak power up to 7 kW for 100 milliseconds. 5 These curves are for Gaussian beam profiles. Flatter beams can handle higher powers (~5%) for longer lengths of time, and beams with hot spots or “super Gaussian” beams the curves must be de-rated by up to 30%.    Contacting Coherent LMC applications engineering for more detailed information.This chart indicates the maximum average power the sensor can  handle based upon beam diameter.This chart can be used to determine intermittent power handling   capability at powers above 3 kW.

Thermopiles  are also capable of integrating long pulse widths. This allows the  thermopile to measure the energy of single pulses between 1  millisecond and 10 seconds in length, and with energies from  millijoules to hundreds of Joules. Long-pulse measurement is  only possible when the thermopiles are used in conjunction  with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP, LabMax-TO, or FieldMaxII-TOP  meters, or when using a PowerMax-USB/RS sensor. This ability to integrate relatively long laser pulses with a  thermopile is necessary when the laser pulse width exceeds the  maximum pulse width rating of pyroelectric sensors. Pyroelectric  sensors are typically limited to maximum pulse widths in the  millisecond range. When the pulse width exceeds milliseconds, a  thermopile is a good solution.   A good “rule of thumb” for using a thermopile for this type of  measurement is to compare the maximum pulse energy you  need to measure with the maximum power rating of a sensor  (maximum power ratings can be found in the Power Sensor Summary Specifications on pages 53 to 54 or in the detailed  product specifications contained on each product page). Common applications for this type of measurement are in the  medical field, especially skin resurfacing and hair removal, and  in material processing applications such as laser welding. These  laser systems often utilize high-energy diode lasers that have  large beam sizes and relatively long pulses. A detector like the  PM150-50C is ideal for these measurements.  It features a large  50 mm aperture size, can handle pulse energies up to 150J, and  can be used air-cooled for single pulse energy measurements (a  PM150-50C will normally need to be water-cooled for continuous  power measurements). Using a LabMax power/energy meter, or a PowerMax-USB/RS  sensor, expands the range of long-pulse Joule measurements  down into the low millijoule level when used with thermopiles  such as the PS10, PS10Q, PS19, and PS19Q sensors. Long-pulse measurements are limited to single pulses in order  to achieve the most accurate measurements.PM10-19C, PM150-50C and PM150-50XC Power Sensors', 'page_label: 52 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  50 Superior Reliability & Performance                 •                 www.coherent.com                 •                 LMC.sales@coherent.com Product OverviewPowerMax Sensors Introduction Coherent PowerMax-USB sensors provide plug-and-play   laser power measurement directly on a PC without the need  for additional electronic instrumentation. The measurement  circuitry typically found in a standalone meter has been reduced  in size to the extent that it can now fit inside a USB connector.  The circuitry and USB connector have been adapted into a  ‘PowerMax-USB’ cable that can be integrated to most Coherent  power sensors providing accurate power measurements of all  types of CW and pulsed sources from the UV to Far IR.  This measurement platform can also be used to measure   the energy in a long laser pulse (typically greater than   1 millisecond in pulse width) by integrating the output of a  thermopile sensor. The PowerMax-RS sensors incorporate the same circuitry inside  an RS-232 connector to provide a convenient platform for  integrating power measurement inside laser processing systems  that often incorporate RS-232 inputs instead of USB.Features • PowerMax-USB provides direct USB 2.0 connection to PC.

The   “LM Model” line utilizes a unique thermopile disk in which   the thermocouples are split into four quadrants, allowing   the sensors to provide beam position information in addition   to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates   traditional thermopile disks that provide power measurement  without beam position information. Both types of sensors can   be used with the PowerMax-USB and PowerMax-RS sensors. PowerMax PC in synchronized   ratiometric trending mode Quad Positioning Enabled PowerMax PC  operating   with multiple   sensors For system integration and for implementations involving customer written software the sensors provide an in depth   command set that is easy to access: • DLL driver supports simple ASCII host commands for remote interfacing using both USB and RS-232 sensors   • National Instruments LabVIEW drivers are supplied for easy LabVIEW integration Power Sensors', 'page_label: 54 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  52 Superior Reliability & Performance                 •                 www.coherent.com                 •                 LMC.sales@coherent.comMeasurement Accuracy   = where U = ‘Percent Calibration Uncertainty’ and W = ‘Wavelength Accuracy’ Example: PowerMax-USB LM-10 used at 1064 nm U = 2% W = 1.5% Measurement Accuracy   =                           =                        =   2.5%Applying Wavelength Compensation AccuracyPowerMax Sensors Introduction Overall measurement accuracy is a combination of calibration uncertainty (found in the sensor specification tables) and the wavelength  compensation accuracy (found in the “Wavelength Compensation Accuracy” table, below). The combined accuracy is based upon practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards Guidelines for Evaluating and  Expressing Uncertainty (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition). The combined accuracy of the measurement is calculated by using  the law of propagation of uncertainty using the “root-sum-of-square” (square root of the sum of squares), sometimes described as  “summing in quadrature” where: Absorption (%) 0.800.850.900.951.01.051.1 0.1 Wavelength (µm)11 0Black Coating w/Quartz WindowBlack Coating Broadband Coating UV CoatingCoherent uses three primary coatings to capture the incident radiation on our thermal sensors. The specifications for each sensor list  which coating is used. Typical wavelength ranges and response curves for these coatings are shown in the chart below. Each sensor  contains a spectral curve generated from reflectance measurements taken with spectrometers. The reflectance data are converted into  a wavelength compensation look-up table that is loaded into the sensor. This data is accessed by selecting a wavelength of operation in  the software.

The mea - sureable power varies significantly by wavelength. See the chart on the next page.  Spectrally calibrated filters are used to attenuate the laser beam, thus allowing  for a higher average power measurement than is typically possible with a photo - diode. They work with CW (continuous wave) as well as pulsed sources greater  than 100 pps. The standard UV/VIS has a removable nose cone that can be used  to reduce stray light, which is helpful when measuring on the low end of the  power range, and the Wand UV/VIS incorporates a thin profile metal enclosure to  fit into tight locations.

Because the spectral response  of the filter and photodiode varies significantly  across this wavelength range it is important to  check the maximum measureable power at the  wavelength of use to make sure the sensor is not  being saturated. This curve plots the maximum measurable power,  which is the saturation level of the photodiode, as  well as the minimum recommended power level,  by wavelength.  Angular Sensitivity The following curves plot the sensitivity to incident angle, and numerical aperture in the case of non-collimated beams.PowerMax - Laser Power Sensors Measurement Linearity Like all silicon photodiodes, the UV/VIS Quantum sensor has  temperature sensitivity in the infrared region.  At 1064 nm, for example, it has a 0.5%/ºC thermal coefficient.   Measurement error of up to 2% are present at 1064 nm after a  10 minute warm-up time due to the electronics inside the sen- sor, and additional error can be present if the ambient measure- ment environment differs from the calibration wavelength listed  on the calibration certificate. In practice, wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm have insignificant  effects due to temperature. See the chart at left to reference the thermal coefficient at the  wavelength of use.Saturation and Minimum Power   UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength Angular Dependence Numerical Aperture Dependence Photo Sensitivity Temperature CharacteristicWavelength (nm)Saturation and Minimum Powe r UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength Power (mW)  0.001 01 2001000 0.010.1110100 2004 00 6008 00 1000Wand UV -VIS Saturation Power Wand UV -VIS Minimum Power Standard UV -VIS Saturation Power Standard UV -VIS Minimum Power Incident Angle (degrees)Angular Dependence   Relative Sensitivity 0.8 02 51.0 0.850.90.95 51 01 52 0 Numerical ApertureNumerical Aperture Dependence   Relative Sensitivity 0.85 00 .61.0 0.90.95 0.10 .2 0.30 .4 0.5 Power Sensors', 'page_label: 63 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  61 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727 Features • Convective air-cooled • Spectrally\\tflat\\tfrom\\t0.19\\tμm\\tto\\t11\\tμm • 1 to 10 mW resolution • 19 mm aperture  • Compatible with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP/TO, FieldMaxII,    and FieldMate meters PM2, PM10 and PM30 Model PM2 PM10 PM30 Wavelength Range (µm)  0.25 to 11 Power Range 10 mW to 2 W 10 mW to 10 W 100 mW to 30 W Long-Pulse Joules Range (J) 0.5 to 2 0.5 to 10 0.5 to 50 Maximum Intermittent Power (<5 min.)

A volume-absorbing substrate mounted in front of  the detector absorbs the bulk of the laser energy rather than all of the energy  striking the front surface of the detector element. This results in a much higher  damage threshold, approaching 2 J/cm 2, at relatively low repetition rates of  approximately 10 pps. A removable front aperture allows easy replacement of  the volume-absorbing substrate should it be damaged (replacement absorbers  may be ordered using part number 0011-8935, PMV1-KIT).

Power ratings are provided for  water-cooled and air-cooled installations. For conductively-cooled installations  a good approximation is that doubling the surface area of the sensor housing  doubles the air-cooled rating. Models that end with “A” are amplified sensors with a 4-pin connector. They  must be supplied with ±15 VDC and draw less than 20 mA. Models that end  with “B” are passive sensors with a BNC output.

With their unique  combination of superior performance and user-friendly  convenience, EnergyMax sensors are your best choice no  matter what your particular laser energy measurement need.  EnergyMax sensors are highly linear in terms of repetition  rate, laser pulse width, and measured energy. They are also  accurate across a broad range of wavelengths due to onboard  wavelength compensation. In addition, automatic temperature  compensation accounts for changes in ambient temperature,  as well as for heat generated by absorption of the laser energy. Temperature compensation also enables the use of user- installable heat sinks for even higher average power handling  capabilities. Coherent EnergyMax sensors are the most linear  and accurate on the market. Sensors with DB-25 cables are designed to work with our stand  alone meters (such as LabMax and FieldMaxII). The USB and RS- 232 models directly interface with a PC or industrial controller.Introduction and Selection ChartsEnergyMax Sensors Introduction Features • Superior damage resistance • High repetition rate operation • Large dynamic range gives each sensor broad coverage • Low noise and excellent linearity for greater accuracy • Large active area Unlike all other thermal detectors, pyroelectrics measure  the rate of change of the detector temperature, rather  than the temperature value itself. As a result, the response  speed of the pyroelectric is usually limited by its electrical circuit  design and the thermal resistance of the absorptive coating.  In contrast, other thermal detectors (such as thermopiles and  bolometers) are limited by slower thermal response speeds,  typically on the order of seconds. Pyroelectric respond only  to changing radiation that is chopped, pulsed or otherwise  modulated; ignoring steady background radiation that is not  changing with time. Their combination of wide uniform spectral  response, sensitivity, and high speed makes pyroelectrics ideal  choices for a vast number of electro-optic applications. The EnergyMax sensor line uses a pyroelectric element   to measure the energy in a laser pulse. It does this by producing  a large electrical charge for a small change in temperature. The  active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor element  and converts it to a voltage that the instrument can measure. The figure below shows the relationship between the current  response of the pyroelectric element and the output voltage  of the sensor circuit. The relationship between the current  response and the output voltage response is fixed so that the  calibrated peak voltage of the output is the integrated energy of  the laser pulse.

In addition, all EnergyMax sensors include onboard electronics that contain built-in wavelength  compensation factors. When using the sensor with a meter such as LabMax or FieldMaxII, enter the wavelength of the laser being  measured into the meter and this will automatically compensate for the sensor output.

This product range enables measurement of  the energy per pulse or average power of pulsed lasers from  the nanojoule to the multi-joule level, over wavelengths from the  deep ultraviolet through the far infrared, and from single pulses  to repetition rates of 10 kHz (with measurement of every pulse).   Furthermore, multiple EnergyMax sensors can share a trigger  (internal or external) for synchronized operation, such as to  enable pulse ratiometry. These meterless sensors are particularly attractive to system  builders because their small size allows them to be easily embedded within instrumentation, and their RS-232 or USB  communications capabilities facilitate automated operation by a  host computer.   Furthermore, EnergyMax USB/RS sensors significantly reduce  the user’s overall cost of ownership by eliminating the need to  purchase a separate, more costly meter with each sensor, and  by reducing annual calibration costs associated with integrating  the electronics into the sensor.  These products are also useful  in the lab and research setting because they can be used as  standalone instruments with a computer, or integrated smoothly  into any experiment with an automated control and data  acquisition system.

Two of the models (J-10SI- LE and J-10SI-HE) incorporate a Silicon photodiode, and one model (J-10GE)  incorporates a Germanium photodiode. All three models contain large 10 mm  clear apertures and operate at repetition rates from single pulse up to 10 kHz. The main difference between Quantum EnergyMax sensors and other  Coherent EnergyMax sensors is their sensitivity. Quantum EnergyMax sensors  are capable of measuring considerably smaller signals than the rest of the  EnergyMax sensor line. They do this by utilizing a photodiode—rather than a  pyroelectric—element.  Due to the quantum nature of their response, photodiode sensors are  inherently more sensitive than pyroelectric sensors, which are thermal-based.  One consequence of this extra sensitivity is the possibility of measurement  error or noise from stray modulated light sources (for example, stray reflections  or room lights) in a laboratory environment. For this reason Quantum  EnergyMax sensors are designed for use with a small integrated input  beam tube, which limits the field of view of the sensor aperture. This tube is  removable for alignment purposes and custom applications.  The following chart plots the minimum and maximum measurable energy of  each sensor across all wavelengths. This chart can be used to determine the  measurable energy range for wavelengths other than those in the specifications  table (1064 nm and 532 nm).

The main difference between a Quantum EnergyMax sensor  and other Coherent EnergyMax sensors is their sensitivity.  A Quantum EnergyMax sensor is capable of measuring  considerably smaller signals than the rest of the EnergyMax  sensor line. They do this by utilizing a photodiode—rather than a  pyroelectric—element.  Due to the quantum nature of their response, photodiode  sensors are inherently more sensitive than pyroelectric sensors, which are thermal-based. One consequence of this extra  sensitivity is the possibility of measurement error or noise from  stray modulated light sources (for example, stray reflections  or room lights) in a laboratory environment. For this reason  Quantum EnergyMax sensors are designed for use with a small  integrated input beam tube, which limits the field of view of the  sensor aperture. This tube is removable for alignment purposes  and custom applications.  The following chart plots the minimum and maximum  measurable energy across all wavelengths. This chart can be  used to determine the measurable energy range for wavelengths  other than that in the specifications table (532 nm).

This page presents a step-by-step procedure for setting up an oscilloscope and using a pyroelectric EnergyMax sensor   to accurately read a peak voltage output. Figure 1 Figure 2Measuring Energy with an OscilloscopeEnergyMax - Laser Energy Sensors 7. If you know your expected laser pulse repetition rate,   set the scope time base to show 2 pulses on the screen.  This helps set the trigger and allows observation of  the true “baseline” of the pulse. For example, for a  laser running at 10 pps, set the scope time base to  20 msec/division. Once proper triggering occurs, use   the vertical adjust to set the baseline of the   EnergyMax voltage pulse to coincide with a  horizontal grid line (see Figure 1). This setting becomes   the zero for the peak voltage reading. 8. Adjust the “time base” of the scope to show a single  EnergyMax pulse and then focus on the leading edge   to accurately read the peak voltage (see Figure 2). To avoid affecting the calibration of the sensor   with a coaxial cable do not lengthen the cable when using the sensor with the oscilloscope. 1.  To assure the accuracy of a pulse energy    measurement, make sure the oscilloscope is   calibrated properly. Also check the date for when   the oscilloscope is due for recalibration. 2. Select a scope that has a sensitivity of at least 2 mV  and a bandwidth of at least 20 MHz. 3. To connect an EnergyMax sensor to an oscilloscope  you will need a J-Power Pro DB25-to-BNC accessory  (available from Coherent). 4. Use the 1 Mohm input impedance of the oscilloscope    when connecting any EnergyMax sensor. 5. Set up the scope as follows:  • Bandwidth to 20 MHz  • DC coupling  • Trigger on “+” slope and “internal” source, or use   the laser sync output and “external” source 6. Estimate the approximate EnergyMax sensor voltage  output expected, based on the Rv (V/J) of the sensor  (available on both the calibration certificate and the   calibration sticker attached to the sensor cable), and   the typical laser pulse energy.

As well as analyzing the power or energy, it is also useful to understand the shape and intensity profile of a   laser beam. For over 25 years Coherent has developed precision instruments that measure,  characterize, and monitor these laser  parameters for thousand of customers around the world. Beam Profilers As a laser beam propagates, changes in the laser cavity, as well as changes in divergence and interactions with optical elements, cause the width and spatial intensity of the beam to change in space and time. Spatial intensity distribution is a fundamental parameter for indicating how a laser beam will  behave in any application. And while theory can sometimes  predict the behavior of a beam, tolerance ranges in mirrors and  lenses, as well as ambient conditions affecting the laser cavity  and beam delivery system, necessitate verification.Two types of beam profilers are available: those that use special cameras as the beam detectors (these are excellent for fast and detailed analyses of the intensity profile of pulsed and CW lasers); and systems that use moving knife-edges  (these have a large dynamic range and can accurately measure small and focused beams). Coherent has both of these types available: the camera-based LaserCam-HR  on pages 124 to 125 and an advanced knife-edge system— BeamMaster—on pages 135 to 137.Introduction to Laser Beam DiagnosticsBeam Diagnostics Introduction Model BeamView Analyzer BeamMaster Wavelength – – Power – CW Beam Position CW + Pulsed CW Propagation M2 – – Beam Profiles    2D CW + Pulsed CW  3D CW + Pulsed CW Page Number 124 to 125 137Summary of   Product Primary   Measurement   Capabilities Beam Diagnostics', 'page_label: 125 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  123 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Introduction to Camera-Based Beam DiagnosticsLaserCam-HR II Coherent BeamView Analyzer systems  are the recognized leader in software,  hardware and optical components  for laser beam analysis. Constant  product improvement based on cus- tomer feedback, and innovation from  beam analysis experts, have made  BeamView Analyzer products the first  choice for laboratory, factory and field  measurements. The key elements of a typical camera- based beam profiling system are the  camera itself, Coherent Beamview  analysis software running on an  appropriate computer and, when  necessary, beam attenuation optics.  The key choice to make is matching  the appropriate camera technology to  your application. Coherent beam diagnostic cameras  are specifically designed or modified  for laser analysis. They provide low noise, maximum linearity, and  uniformity of response—needed for maximum measurement  accuracy. All of these diagnostic cameras accept C-Mount optical  accessories and are delivered without a cover (glass/plastic win- dow) over the sensor array. Instead, a LDFP (Low-Distortion Face  Plate) filter is supplied with each camera—a laser-grade neutral  density filter made of glass specified and polished specifically for  laser diagnostic analysis. The LDFP filter is mounted in a stan- dard C-Mount ring and provides attenuation of ambient room  light so that the camera can be used with normal room lights. USB 2.0 Beam Diagnostic Camera Family   Coherent pioneered the ease-of-use of digital USB 2.0 bus-pow- ered, high-resolution, large area cameras requiring only a single  cable for both video transfer and camera power. The LaserCam- HR family of beam diagnostic cameras includes the LaserCam-HR  II CCD cameras, the LaserCam-HR-UV and the LaserCam-HR- InGaAs models, covering the measurement spectrum from the  deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths. With a broad spectral range covering 190 nm to 1700 nm, there  is a LaserCam-HR camera profiler system ideally suited for nearly  any demanding laser measurement application including scien- tific, excimer lasers, telecommunications sources, and military  laser systems.

Variable camera exposure time available with the entire Laser- Cam-HR camera family allows imaging of higher repetition rate  sources and lets the user decrease/increase the signal intensity  levels using exposure time instead of external attenuation. This  feature is especially suited for the LaserCam-HR-InGaAs, with its  impressive spatial uniformity characteristics.

This mode is ideal  for monitoring the laser and observing changes in the form and  structure of the beam as it is adjusted. It also allows for real-time  tuning to achieve optimum beam profile quality and laser-cavity  alignment.

The user can scroll through the analysis results of individual images, and also view the minimum, maximum and sigma (standard deviation) values. This makes comparing  individual samples to the time-dependent statistical data easy.  Thus, the jitter and stability of parameters, such as power,  energy, pointing direction, ellipticity and beam size, etc., can be  analyzed simultaneously with a polar beam wander plot.  Pass/Fail Analysis  Pass/fail analysis allows simultaneous real-time monitoring of all,  or any one of the analysis results against user-specified minimum/ maximum limits. Any combination of, or all the fault actions can  be activated to signal a test failure, initiate a visual alarm, an audio  alarm, stop data capture, reject/save a failed sample, and generation  of a TTL trigger pulse output signal.

For example, a typical diagnostics camera saturates at  only ~0.5 μW/cm2 power density (at ~633 nm) or at ~9 nJ/cm2   (at 1064 nm) pulsed energy density. If the camera has an  electronic shutter, it can be used for some CW beam attenuation,  but there is more flexibility in using optical attenuation. Any  attenuation optics introduced in the beam path must be  manufactured to exacting specifications. The optics must be  laser-grade substrate, and use the proper flatness and wedge to  avoid etaloning and fringing, so that the beam is not distorted by  the introduction of the attenuation. We offer attenuation optics  that are designed to these specifications and packaged for use  with our cameras. Typical attenuations are 1:1 to 400,000:1, but even larger attenuations are possible. All Coherent diagnostic cameras  accept C-Mount optics and accessories, and are delivered  without a standard window in front of the sensor array. Such  windows are liable to distort the optical beam. However, a   LDFP (Low-Distortion Face Plate) filter is supplied with each  camera purchased from Coherent. The LDFP is a laser-grade  optic specified and polished for diagnostics use. It is mounted  in a housing with C-Mount threads and provides attenuation of  room light so that the camera can be used with the lights on.   For operation below 400 nm, the LDFP must be removed. The Continuously Variable Attenuator Modules (C-VARM and UV C-VARM) contain two wedge attenuators that are  continuously variable and a step attenuator that allows  attenuation from 107:1 down to 3000:1. The C-VARM and  UV C-VARM can be finely adjusted to achieve both precise  attenuation levels and maximum use of the camera’s optical  dynamic range.  The Variable Attenuator Module (VARM) is a triple-wheel filter holder that contains three filters per wheel. The filters are  made to our exacting specifications for transmission value and  material quality. The VARM is adjustable in attenuation in 64  discrete steps of approximately 16% reduction each time from  400,000:1 down to 1:1. The VARM can be easily returned to  exactly the same attenuation level as previously used. The BeamCUBE Fixed-Attenuator Modules (BCUBE and UV-BCUBE) provide fixed attenuation and beam pickoff for  performing diagnostics on high power laser sources. The BCUBE  and UV-BCUBE utilize the front surface reflection from an  uncoated laser mirror to achieve beam samples at 2% to 10%  of the incident radiation, depending upon beam polarization.  Multiple BCUBEs can be coupled together for even higher fixed  attenuation levels.Laser-Grade Attenuation Optics for Cameras Beam Diagnostics', 'page_label: 135 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  133 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727 VARM, LaserCam-HR-InGaAs, C-VARM, BCUBE, C-Mount  Flanges and Barrel In general, a camera cannot sense less than ~λ/4 total distortion  in the beam, so if a series of filters is used, they must be made  to very exacting laser-grade specifications. Attenuating optics  from Coherent are manufactured to better than a λ/10 surface  specification, so at least six optics in series can be used.  Calculate the Low-Distortion Face Plate (LDFP) and each BCUBE  as one optic, and the VARM or C-VARM as three optics each.BCUBE, UV-BCUBE, VARM, C-VARM, UV C-VARM and all other Coherent cameras  have female C-Mount threading, making them easy to connect with the male  C-Mount connection flange provided with each attenuator. Also, all attenuators  have 1/4-20 tapped holes for independent post or plate mounting.  The C-Mount flanges (threaded rings) also have a female RMS microscope  thread. This allows a microscope objective to be coupled to the attenuators  and extension barrels in order to create a flexible close-up imaging system for  analysis of small/focused beams, fiber optics, laser diodes or LEDs. Avoiding Multi-Filter Beam Distortion The wavefront distortion through a number of optical filters can be calculated  by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the wavefront distortion  of the individual components. For example, if the individual optics are made to  λ/10 specifications and six are used, a total λ/4 RMS wavefront distortion will be  introduced to the beam: t = Transmission Valu et = 1.00 t = 1.00 t = 1.00Laser Beamline C-Mount Thread 50 mm (1.97 in.)70 mm (2.76 in.)86 mm (3.39 in. ) 40 mm (1.57 in. )IN FIXED A TTENUA TION VARIABLE ATTENUA TIONMAX MIN MAX MINOUT79.4 mm (3.13 in.) 63.5 mm (2.5 in.) 58.7 mm (2.3 in.) 57.1 mm (2.25 in. ) 44.5 mm (1.75 in.)

Attenuator Selection Attenuation is selected on the basis of power density in   W/cm2 or energy density in J/cm2. The attenuation from the  camera’s Low-Distortion Face Plate (LDFP) will allow an average  power density of up to 1.2 mW/cm2. There are then only two  more steps to attenuation selection: 1) Choose either the VARM or the C-VARM for up to 1W/cm2. 2) In addition or alternatively, use a BCUBE beamsplitter    module to pick off between 2% and 10% of the beam  (depending on polarization and wavelength). 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.25 ** Beam Diagnostics', 'page_label: 136 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  134 Superior Reliability & Performance                 •                 www.coherent.com                 •                 LMC.sales@coherent.com  BIP-5000Z and BIP-12F attached to a LaserCam-HR BIP-5000Z BIP-12FFeatures • UV operation from 10 nm to 355 nm • Choice of 12 mm or 30 x 40 mm diameter apertures • Operation with BeamView Analyzer Systems These Extreme-UV Beam Profiler Optics use UV-to-visible fluorescence  converter face plates to couple the input laser beam to any appropriate  Coherent camera.

Selectable averaging  of 1 to 20 samples provides noise reduction and maximizes  measurement accuracy. Data can be collected, displayed, stored  and continuously streamed via USB. All screen images can be  captured and stored, or printed. BeamMaster can measure focused beam spots as small as   3 μm with 0.1 μm resolution and has an aperture as large as 9  mm with 1 μm resolution for larger beams. Measurements can  be made from 190 nm to 1100 nm (Si-Enhanced) and from 800  nm to 1800 nm (InGaAs). Input powers can be as low as 10 μW.   There is automatic gain control and two internal distortion-free  optical attenuation filters are included (Si-Enhanced models) Multiple Knife-Edges for Greater Resolution and Accuracy BeamMaster is an advancement over the more common types  of beam profilers, which use two orthogonal knife-edges or  slits to scan the beam profile. The BeamMaster model BM-7  uses seven individual knife-edges on a rotating drum to scan  the beam through seven different axes in a single rotation. This  provides more accurate measurements of the true beam shape  and dimensions by tomographically combining the data from all  seven scans to reconstruct a profile of the beam. This technique  also makes locating the angular orientation of elliptical beam  major/minor axes much easier than searching by rotating the  sensor head around the optical beam axis. For applications with  circular or near-Gaussian beams, the lower-cost BM-3, with only  three knife-edges, is also available.105 mm (4.13 in.) 3.5 mm (0.14 in.)50 mm (1.97 in.)87 mm (3.43 in.) 35.2 mm (1.39 in.)52.5 mm (2.07 in.) 2x 8-32 Thread 8-32 ThreadEntrance Aperture Removable Filter (UV and Si only )BM-7:  15.1 mm (0.6 in.)BM-3:  13.1 mm (0.5 in. )BM-3: 13.1 mm (0.5 in.)

This information can be  displayed every rotation, strip-charted, and sent to  a file. Two orthogonal profiles can be displayed and  the beam widths can be digitally displayed for any  three user-chosen clip levels. A Gaussian-fit profile  can be overlaid on any chosen measured profile  Knife-Edge Beam Profiler and the fit and correlation parameters can be displayed. To obtain the maximum profile detail, the system automatically centers the profile and zooms  to display ~3 times the beam width, and the profile intensity data is autoscaled (optional) to  fit the display height. Note: Unlike the PCI version, the USB model is always in high resolution  mode for maximum detail. Beam Position and Ellipticity The beam centroid position can be continuously monitored relative to the center of the  sensor area, along with the beam shape, ellipticity (major and minor axes) and angular  orientation. A zoom function is available and the user can choose the clip level and   strip-chart the position (X and Y) data to monitor short-term or long-term, time-dependent  stability or drift. Power Measurement The beam power can be displayed either as a digital readout or in combination with an  analog “needle.” Units can be chosen as μW, mW or dBm, and the user can offset the zero  and zoom in on any part of the power range. Attenuator (filter) files can be selected, and a  test range can be selected and displayed to monitor beam power within specific limits, with  optional audio alarms. Data Collecting and QA Testing Data regarding beam size, position and power can be continuously displayed in analog, digital  and strip chart forms on the computer screen. Data can also be logged to a data file in real  time for later processing or test report generation. Pass/Fail testing can be performed on  measured results for acceptance within specific tolerances. All screen images also can be  captured and stored as BMP or JPG files. 2D and 3D Intensity Plots The projection function provides either a 2D or 3D view of the beam intensity profile.   The projection is created using reconstructive tomography. The   same method is used to produce 3D images with X-ray systems.   The more knife edges, the greater the level of detail that can  be obtained. For a beam distribution that is significantly non- Gaussian, such as that from a diode laser, the standard seven- knife-edge system can reconstruct a plot that closely matches   the real beam. When examining near-Gaussian beams, the   three-knife-edge system gives an accurate intensity distribution.   The 2D contour maps and the 3D isometric plots can be   displayed with or without scan axis and grids, and the isometric  plots can be rotated for easier viewing of the detailed structure.

ISO 17025 is the single most  important metrology standard for test and measurement products,  and external accreditation is a formal recognition that a calibration  laboratory is using valid and appropriate methods and is competent to  carry out specified tests or calibrations. Scope of Accreditation The scope of accreditation applies to the laser/electrical calibration of nearly   all the company’s catalog pyroelectric laser energy sensors, thermopile laser   power sensors and meter electronics. Pages in this catalog that contain products   that fall within the scope of accreditation are clearly identified by the combined   ILAC-MRA/ANAB mark shown below: The formal scope of accreditation can be found on the Coherent website at http:/www.coherent.com within Company tab > Quality.   It can also be found within the ANAB website at http://www.anab.org. Click the “Accredited Organizations” button on their homepage. ISO 17025 is an international standard that governs calibration labs. It requires labs demonstrate that they operate a quality  management system that controls the processes and documentation, including auditing and corrective action processes. It also  requires adherence to rigorous technical requirements that ensure valid results are generated.  In terms of specific technical requirements, ISO/IEC 17025 ensures that a company:  • maintains testing facilities and equipment to specified standards  • ensures protocols are fully documented  • trains workers to an appropriate level of competence  • confirms validity and appropriateness of methods, especially so called “non-standard” methods such as those used to     calibrate laser measurement equipment, which have been developed internally  • uses accepted mathematical methods for calculating results  • verifies that purchased test equipment meets proper requirements, and that all equipment used to produce accredited     calibrations has itself received ISO 17025 accredited calibrations  • has a traceable path of calibration to independently maintained national or international standards  • provides both as received and outgoing testing data to customers in an approved format  • ensures the calibration certificate meets the requirements of the standard The outcome of all these efforts is that customers can have confidence that a laboratory achieves verifiably correct  results, and that these results will be reported in an unambiguous manner.Calibration and Service ISO 17025 Accreditation Calibration & Service', 'page_label: 141 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  139 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Limited Warranty Coherent, Inc., warrants to the original purchaser that its laser  power and energy meters and sensors are free from defects in  materials and workmanship and comply with all specifications,  active at the time of purchase, for a period of twelve (12) months.

With their unique  combination of superior performance and user-friendly  convenience, EnergyMax sensors are your best choice no  matter what your particular laser energy measurement need.  EnergyMax sensors are highly linear in terms of repetition  rate, laser pulse width, and measured energy. They are also  accurate across a broad range of wavelengths due to onboard  wavelength compensation. In addition, automatic temperature  compensation accounts for changes in ambient temperature,  as well as for heat generated by absorption of the laser energy. Temperature compensation also enables the use of user- installable heat sinks for even higher average power handling  capabilities. Coherent EnergyMax sensors are the most linear  and accurate on the market. Sensors with DB-25 cables are designed to work with our stand  alone meters (such as LabMax and FieldMaxII). The USB and RS- 232 models directly interface with a PC or industrial controller.Introduction and Selection ChartsEnergyMax Sensors Introduction Features • Superior damage resistance • High repetition rate operation • Large dynamic range gives each sensor broad coverage • Low noise and excellent linearity for greater accuracy • Large active area Unlike all other thermal detectors, pyroelectrics measure  the rate of change of the detector temperature, rather  than the temperature value itself. As a result, the response  speed of the pyroelectric is usually limited by its electrical circuit  design and the thermal resistance of the absorptive coating.  In contrast, other thermal detectors (such as thermopiles and  bolometers) are limited by slower thermal response speeds,  typically on the order of seconds. Pyroelectric respond only  to changing radiation that is chopped, pulsed or otherwise  modulated; ignoring steady background radiation that is not  changing with time. Their combination of wide uniform spectral  response, sensitivity, and high speed makes pyroelectrics ideal  choices for a vast number of electro-optic applications. The EnergyMax sensor line uses a pyroelectric element   to measure the energy in a laser pulse. It does this by producing  a large electrical charge for a small change in temperature. The  active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor element  and converts it to a voltage that the instrument can measure. The figure below shows the relationship between the current  response of the pyroelectric element and the output voltage  of the sensor circuit. The relationship between the current  response and the output voltage response is fixed so that the  calibrated peak voltage of the output is the integrated energy of  the laser pulse.

In addition, all EnergyMax sensors include onboard electronics that contain built-in wavelength  compensation factors. When using the sensor with a meter such as LabMax or FieldMaxII, enter the wavelength of the laser being  measured into the meter and this will automatically compensate for the sensor output.

The combined accuracy is based upon practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards Guidelines for Evaluating and  Expressing Uncertainty (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition). The combined accuracy of the measurement is calculated   by using the law of propagation of uncertainty using the “root-sum-of-square” (square root of the sum of squares), sometimes   described as “summing in quadrature” where:Applying Wavelength Compensation AccuracyEnergyMax Sensors Introduction  Wavelength Compensation Accuracy (%) Calibration  (for wavelengths other than the  Wavelength Model calibration wavelength) (nm) All Multipurpose Sensors (MaxBlack Coating) ±2 1064 All High Repetition Rate Sensors (Diffuse Metallic Coating) ±3 1064  J-50MB-YAG ±2 1064 J-50MB-IR ±3 1064, 2940  J-25MB-IR ±4 1064  J-25MUV-193 ±3 193 J-25MUV-248 ±3 248 J-50MUV-193 ±4 193 J-50MUV-248 ±4 248 J-10SI-LE ±5 532 J-10SI-HE ±5 532 J-10GE ±5 1064Wavelength   Compensation   Accuracy U2 + W2  32 + 52 9 + 25  22 + 22 4 + 4  22 + 22 4 + 4 32 + 52 9 + 25 Energy Sensors', 'page_label: 101 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  99 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Introduction and Selection ChartsEnergyMax Sensors Introduction Use the following chart to identify the energy range for the standard DB-25 EnergyMax models.

This characteristic is coating  dependent, so sensors with diffusers may have a narrower spectral range than similar sensors without diffusers. The spectral compensation of each sensor is unique to that serial number, and is based upon spectral scans performed on each  sensor disk (and on each optic if the sensor has a diffuser). The spectral compensation provides greater measurement accuracy for  wavelengths that differ from the optical calibration wavelength.

This product range enables measurement of  the energy per pulse or average power of pulsed lasers from  the nanojoule to the multi-joule level, over wavelengths from the  deep ultraviolet through the far infrared, and from single pulses  to repetition rates of 10 kHz (with measurement of every pulse).   Furthermore, multiple EnergyMax sensors can share a trigger  (internal or external) for synchronized operation, such as to  enable pulse ratiometry. These meterless sensors are particularly attractive to system  builders because their small size allows them to be easily embedded within instrumentation, and their RS-232 or USB  communications capabilities facilitate automated operation by a  host computer.   Furthermore, EnergyMax USB/RS sensors significantly reduce  the user’s overall cost of ownership by eliminating the need to  purchase a separate, more costly meter with each sensor, and  by reducing annual calibration costs associated with integrating  the electronics into the sensor.  These products are also useful  in the lab and research setting because they can be used as  standalone instruments with a computer, or integrated smoothly  into any experiment with an automated control and data  acquisition system. The Meterless Advantage Low Cost of Ownership • Lower initial price – because no   separate meter • Lower calibration cost – because   electronics are integrated into   sensor • Easy to adapt with apps software   and drivers • Less costly multi-channel operationEmbedded OEM Integration • Flexibility of RS-232 and USB   PC interfaces • Compact size • Easy ASCII host commands • USB sensors attach as virtual   COM portState-of-the-Art Sensor  Energy Technology • Based upon industry leading   EnergyMax sensors • High accuracy • High damage threshold • High repetition rate with large   active areas • High dynamic rangeFeatures • Direct USB and RS-232 interfaces • Supports multi-channel and    ratiometry with shared trigger • Internal and external triggers • PC Application Software included Energy Sensors', 'page_label: 105 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  103 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Main Product Features • Able to measure every pulse up to 10 kHz and stream   this data over the host port (USB only).

Two of the models (J-10SI- LE and J-10SI-HE) incorporate a Silicon photodiode, and one model (J-10GE)  incorporates a Germanium photodiode. All three models contain large 10 mm  clear apertures and operate at repetition rates from single pulse up to 10 kHz. The main difference between Quantum EnergyMax sensors and other  Coherent EnergyMax sensors is their sensitivity. Quantum EnergyMax sensors  are capable of measuring considerably smaller signals than the rest of the  EnergyMax sensor line. They do this by utilizing a photodiode—rather than a  pyroelectric—element.  Due to the quantum nature of their response, photodiode sensors are  inherently more sensitive than pyroelectric sensors, which are thermal-based.  One consequence of this extra sensitivity is the possibility of measurement  error or noise from stray modulated light sources (for example, stray reflections  or room lights) in a laboratory environment. For this reason Quantum  EnergyMax sensors are designed for use with a small integrated input  beam tube, which limits the field of view of the sensor aperture. This tube is  removable for alignment purposes and custom applications.  The following chart plots the minimum and maximum measurable energy of  each sensor across all wavelengths. This chart can be used to determine the  measurable energy range for wavelengths other than those in the specifications  table (1064 nm and 532 nm).

This page presents a step-by-step procedure for setting up an oscilloscope and using a pyroelectric EnergyMax sensor   to accurately read a peak voltage output. Figure 1 Figure 2Measuring Energy with an OscilloscopeEnergyMax - Laser Energy Sensors 7. If you know your expected laser pulse repetition rate,   set the scope time base to show 2 pulses on the screen.  This helps set the trigger and allows observation of  the true “baseline” of the pulse. For example, for a  laser running at 10 pps, set the scope time base to  20 msec/division. Once proper triggering occurs, use   the vertical adjust to set the baseline of the   EnergyMax voltage pulse to coincide with a  horizontal grid line (see Figure 1). This setting becomes   the zero for the peak voltage reading. 8. Adjust the “time base” of the scope to show a single  EnergyMax pulse and then focus on the leading edge   to accurately read the peak voltage (see Figure 2). To avoid affecting the calibration of the sensor   with a coaxial cable do not lengthen the cable when using the sensor with the oscilloscope. 1.  To assure the accuracy of a pulse energy    measurement, make sure the oscilloscope is   calibrated properly. Also check the date for when   the oscilloscope is due for recalibration. 2. Select a scope that has a sensitivity of at least 2 mV  and a bandwidth of at least 20 MHz. 3. To connect an EnergyMax sensor to an oscilloscope  you will need a J-Power Pro DB25-to-BNC accessory  (available from Coherent). 4. Use the 1 Mohm input impedance of the oscilloscope    when connecting any EnergyMax sensor. 5. Set up the scope as follows:  • Bandwidth to 20 MHz  • DC coupling  • Trigger on “+” slope and “internal” source, or use   the laser sync output and “external” source 6. Estimate the approximate EnergyMax sensor voltage  output expected, based on the Rv (V/J) of the sensor  (available on both the calibration certificate and the   calibration sticker attached to the sensor cable), and   the typical laser pulse energy.

As well as analyzing the power or energy, it is also useful to understand the shape and intensity profile of a   laser beam. For over 25 years Coherent has developed precision instruments that measure,  characterize, and monitor these laser  parameters for thousand of customers around the world. Beam Profilers As a laser beam propagates, changes in the laser cavity, as well as changes in divergence and interactions with optical elements, cause the width and spatial intensity of the beam to change in space and time. Spatial intensity distribution is a fundamental parameter for indicating how a laser beam will  behave in any application. And while theory can sometimes  predict the behavior of a beam, tolerance ranges in mirrors and  lenses, as well as ambient conditions affecting the laser cavity  and beam delivery system, necessitate verification.Two types of beam profilers are available: those that use special cameras as the beam detectors (these are excellent for fast and detailed analyses of the intensity profile of pulsed and CW lasers); and systems that use moving knife-edges  (these have a large dynamic range and can accurately measure small and focused beams). Coherent has both of these types available: the camera-based LaserCam-HR  on pages 124 to 125 and an advanced knife-edge system— BeamMaster—on pages 135 to 137.Introduction to Laser Beam DiagnosticsBeam Diagnostics Introduction Model BeamView Analyzer BeamMaster Wavelength – – Power – CW Beam Position CW + Pulsed CW Propagation M2 – – Beam Profiles    2D CW + Pulsed CW  3D CW + Pulsed CW Page Number 124 to 125 137Summary of   Product Primary   Measurement   Capabilities Beam Diagnostics', 'page_label: 125 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  123 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Introduction to Camera-Based Beam DiagnosticsLaserCam-HR II Coherent BeamView Analyzer systems  are the recognized leader in software,  hardware and optical components  for laser beam analysis. Constant  product improvement based on cus- tomer feedback, and innovation from  beam analysis experts, have made  BeamView Analyzer products the first  choice for laboratory, factory and field  measurements. The key elements of a typical camera- based beam profiling system are the  camera itself, Coherent Beamview  analysis software running on an  appropriate computer and, when  necessary, beam attenuation optics.  The key choice to make is matching  the appropriate camera technology to  your application. Coherent beam diagnostic cameras  are specifically designed or modified  for laser analysis. They provide low noise, maximum linearity, and  uniformity of response—needed for maximum measurement  accuracy. All of these diagnostic cameras accept C-Mount optical  accessories and are delivered without a cover (glass/plastic win- dow) over the sensor array. Instead, a LDFP (Low-Distortion Face  Plate) filter is supplied with each camera—a laser-grade neutral  density filter made of glass specified and polished specifically for  laser diagnostic analysis. The LDFP filter is mounted in a stan- dard C-Mount ring and provides attenuation of ambient room  light so that the camera can be used with normal room lights. USB 2.0 Beam Diagnostic Camera Family   Coherent pioneered the ease-of-use of digital USB 2.0 bus-pow- ered, high-resolution, large area cameras requiring only a single  cable for both video transfer and camera power. The LaserCam- HR family of beam diagnostic cameras includes the LaserCam-HR  II CCD cameras, the LaserCam-HR-UV and the LaserCam-HR- InGaAs models, covering the measurement spectrum from the  deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths. With a broad spectral range covering 190 nm to 1700 nm, there  is a LaserCam-HR camera profiler system ideally suited for nearly  any demanding laser measurement application including scien- tific, excimer lasers, telecommunications sources, and military  laser systems. Important Considerations   • Ease-of-use connectivity   • High-speed USB 2.0 Interface   • USB bus-powered low voltage operation• Broad spectral range   • LaserCam-HR II 190 nm to 1100 nm      (400 to 1100 nm with LDFP)      (190 to 355 nm with BIP-12F)   • LaserCam-HR II-UV DUV to 355 nm   • LaserCam-HR-InGaAs 900 nm to 1700 nm • Large dynamic range • Digital output  through USB 2.0 eliminates the need for    an interface card (frame-grabber) • High-accuracy beam diameter calculations • Excellent beam spatial uniformity • Variable camera exposure time • High-speed image capture rates    (15 to 25 frames per second) • Pass/Fail TTL level output • RS-232 and TCP/IP communication protocols • All LaserCam-HR camera systems are RoHS    compliant • Cameras ship with BeamView diagnostics software   • Windows 7 & 10 (32-bit and 64-bit) compatible Multiple channel camera support of different LaserCam-HR cam- era models is available for all three LaserCam-HR camera types  (UV, visible, and InGaAs). Variable camera exposure time available with the entire Laser- Cam-HR camera family allows imaging of higher repetition rate  sources and lets the user decrease/increase the signal intensity  levels using exposure time instead of external attenuation. This  feature is especially suited for the LaserCam-HR-InGaAs, with its  impressive spatial uniformity characteristics.

A complete control and data transfer   command set is provided to allow users to develop their   own remote control application for interfacing with the   BeamView Analyzer software platform. The BeamView-   USB software package includes an example LabVIEW VI   for remote access to most BeamView features at a host   computer running LabVIEW. Beam Analysis and Statistics  BeamView Analyzer software calculations are compatible with the International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines for laser  beam measurement:  • Peak and centroid beam position   • Beam ellipticity including angular position and major/minor axis information  • Circularity  • D4σ diameters and widths  • Guassian fit including coefficient, centroid, and “roughness of fit”  • Aperture fit and uniformity  • Total/relative power   • Peak power/energy density   • Percent power within an aperture Continuous on-line statistical analysis display Calculations Pass/Fail test settingsPolar beam wander plot screen Fault Actions  Dialog BoxBeam Stability The continuous on-line statistical analysis display shows results of all, or a combination of, functions and pass/fail parameters for all captured samples and accumulated results. The user can scroll through the analysis results of individual images, and also view the minimum, maximum and sigma (standard deviation) values. This makes comparing  individual samples to the time-dependent statistical data easy.  Thus, the jitter and stability of parameters, such as power,  energy, pointing direction, ellipticity and beam size, etc., can be  analyzed simultaneously with a polar beam wander plot.  Pass/Fail Analysis  Pass/fail analysis allows simultaneous real-time monitoring of all,  or any one of the analysis results against user-specified minimum/ maximum limits. Any combination of, or all the fault actions can  be activated to signal a test failure, initiate a visual alarm, an audio  alarm, stop data capture, reject/save a failed sample, and generation  of a TTL trigger pulse output signal.

For example, a typical diagnostics camera saturates at  only ~0.5 μW/cm2 power density (at ~633 nm) or at ~9 nJ/cm2   (at 1064 nm) pulsed energy density. If the camera has an  electronic shutter, it can be used for some CW beam attenuation,  but there is more flexibility in using optical attenuation. Any  attenuation optics introduced in the beam path must be  manufactured to exacting specifications. The optics must be  laser-grade substrate, and use the proper flatness and wedge to  avoid etaloning and fringing, so that the beam is not distorted by  the introduction of the attenuation. We offer attenuation optics  that are designed to these specifications and packaged for use  with our cameras. Typical attenuations are 1:1 to 400,000:1, but even larger attenuations are possible. All Coherent diagnostic cameras  accept C-Mount optics and accessories, and are delivered  without a standard window in front of the sensor array. Such  windows are liable to distort the optical beam. However, a   LDFP (Low-Distortion Face Plate) filter is supplied with each  camera purchased from Coherent. The LDFP is a laser-grade  optic specified and polished for diagnostics use. It is mounted  in a housing with C-Mount threads and provides attenuation of  room light so that the camera can be used with the lights on.   For operation below 400 nm, the LDFP must be removed. The Continuously Variable Attenuator Modules (C-VARM and UV C-VARM) contain two wedge attenuators that are  continuously variable and a step attenuator that allows  attenuation from 107:1 down to 3000:1. The C-VARM and  UV C-VARM can be finely adjusted to achieve both precise  attenuation levels and maximum use of the camera’s optical  dynamic range.  The Variable Attenuator Module (VARM) is a triple-wheel filter holder that contains three filters per wheel. The filters are  made to our exacting specifications for transmission value and  material quality. The VARM is adjustable in attenuation in 64  discrete steps of approximately 16% reduction each time from  400,000:1 down to 1:1. The VARM can be easily returned to  exactly the same attenuation level as previously used. The BeamCUBE Fixed-Attenuator Modules (BCUBE and UV-BCUBE) provide fixed attenuation and beam pickoff for  performing diagnostics on high power laser sources. The BCUBE  and UV-BCUBE utilize the front surface reflection from an  uncoated laser mirror to achieve beam samples at 2% to 10%  of the incident radiation, depending upon beam polarization.  Multiple BCUBEs can be coupled together for even higher fixed  attenuation levels.Laser-Grade Attenuation Optics for Cameras Beam Diagnostics', 'page_label: 135 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  133 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727 VARM, LaserCam-HR-InGaAs, C-VARM, BCUBE, C-Mount  Flanges and Barrel In general, a camera cannot sense less than ~λ/4 total distortion  in the beam, so if a series of filters is used, they must be made  to very exacting laser-grade specifications. Attenuating optics  from Coherent are manufactured to better than a λ/10 surface  specification, so at least six optics in series can be used.  Calculate the Low-Distortion Face Plate (LDFP) and each BCUBE  as one optic, and the VARM or C-VARM as three optics each.BCUBE, UV-BCUBE, VARM, C-VARM, UV C-VARM and all other Coherent cameras  have female C-Mount threading, making them easy to connect with the male  C-Mount connection flange provided with each attenuator. Also, all attenuators  have 1/4-20 tapped holes for independent post or plate mounting.  The C-Mount flanges (threaded rings) also have a female RMS microscope  thread. This allows a microscope objective to be coupled to the attenuators  and extension barrels in order to create a flexible close-up imaging system for  analysis of small/focused beams, fiber optics, laser diodes or LEDs. Avoiding Multi-Filter Beam Distortion The wavefront distortion through a number of optical filters can be calculated  by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the wavefront distortion  of the individual components. For example, if the individual optics are made to  λ/10 specifications and six are used, a total λ/4 RMS wavefront distortion will be  introduced to the beam: t = Transmission Valu et = 1.00 t = 1.00 t = 1.00Laser Beamline C-Mount Thread 50 mm (1.97 in.)70 mm (2.76 in.)86 mm (3.39 in. ) 40 mm (1.57 in. )IN FIXED A TTENUA TION VARIABLE ATTENUA TIONMAX MIN MAX MINOUT79.4 mm (3.13 in.) 63.5 mm (2.5 in.) 58.7 mm (2.3 in.) 57.1 mm (2.25 in. ) 44.5 mm (1.75 in.)

Selectable averaging  of 1 to 20 samples provides noise reduction and maximizes  measurement accuracy. Data can be collected, displayed, stored  and continuously streamed via USB. All screen images can be  captured and stored, or printed. BeamMaster can measure focused beam spots as small as   3 μm with 0.1 μm resolution and has an aperture as large as 9  mm with 1 μm resolution for larger beams.

The BeamMaster model BM-7  uses seven individual knife-edges on a rotating drum to scan  the beam through seven different axes in a single rotation. This  provides more accurate measurements of the true beam shape  and dimensions by tomographically combining the data from all  seven scans to reconstruct a profile of the beam. This technique  also makes locating the angular orientation of elliptical beam  major/minor axes much easier than searching by rotating the  sensor head around the optical beam axis. For applications with  circular or near-Gaussian beams, the lower-cost BM-3, with only  three knife-edges, is also available.105 mm (4.13 in.) 3.5 mm (0.14 in.)50 mm (1.97 in.)87 mm (3.43 in.) 35.2 mm (1.39 in.)52.5 mm (2.07 in.) 2x 8-32 Thread 8-32 ThreadEntrance Aperture Removable Filter (UV and Si only )BM-7:  15.1 mm (0.6 in.)BM-3:  13.1 mm (0.5 in. )BM-3: 13.1 mm (0.5 in.)

This information can be  displayed every rotation, strip-charted, and sent to  a file. Two orthogonal profiles can be displayed and  the beam widths can be digitally displayed for any  three user-chosen clip levels. A Gaussian-fit profile  can be overlaid on any chosen measured profile  Knife-Edge Beam Profiler and the fit and correlation parameters can be displayed. To obtain the maximum profile detail, the system automatically centers the profile and zooms  to display ~3 times the beam width, and the profile intensity data is autoscaled (optional) to  fit the display height. Note: Unlike the PCI version, the USB model is always in high resolution  mode for maximum detail. Beam Position and Ellipticity The beam centroid position can be continuously monitored relative to the center of the  sensor area, along with the beam shape, ellipticity (major and minor axes) and angular  orientation. A zoom function is available and the user can choose the clip level and   strip-chart the position (X and Y) data to monitor short-term or long-term, time-dependent  stability or drift. Power Measurement The beam power can be displayed either as a digital readout or in combination with an  analog “needle.” Units can be chosen as μW, mW or dBm, and the user can offset the zero  and zoom in on any part of the power range. Attenuator (filter) files can be selected, and a  test range can be selected and displayed to monitor beam power within specific limits, with  optional audio alarms. Data Collecting and QA Testing Data regarding beam size, position and power can be continuously displayed in analog, digital  and strip chart forms on the computer screen. Data can also be logged to a data file in real  time for later processing or test report generation. Pass/Fail testing can be performed on  measured results for acceptance within specific tolerances. All screen images also can be  captured and stored as BMP or JPG files. 2D and 3D Intensity Plots The projection function provides either a 2D or 3D view of the beam intensity profile.   The projection is created using reconstructive tomography. The   same method is used to produce 3D images with X-ray systems.   The more knife edges, the greater the level of detail that can  be obtained. For a beam distribution that is significantly non- Gaussian, such as that from a diode laser, the standard seven- knife-edge system can reconstruct a plot that closely matches   the real beam. When examining near-Gaussian beams, the   three-knife-edge system gives an accurate intensity distribution.   The 2D contour maps and the 3D isometric plots can be   displayed with or without scan axis and grids, and the isometric  plots can be rotated for easier viewing of the detailed structure.

ISO 17025 is the single most  important metrology standard for test and measurement products,  and external accreditation is a formal recognition that a calibration  laboratory is using valid and appropriate methods and is competent to  carry out specified tests or calibrations. Scope of Accreditation The scope of accreditation applies to the laser/electrical calibration of nearly   all the company’s catalog pyroelectric laser energy sensors, thermopile laser   power sensors and meter electronics. Pages in this catalog that contain products   that fall within the scope of accreditation are clearly identified by the combined   ILAC-MRA/ANAB mark shown below: The formal scope of accreditation can be found on the Coherent website at http:/www.coherent.com within Company tab > Quality.   It can also be found within the ANAB website at http://www.anab.org. Click the “Accredited Organizations” button on their homepage. ISO 17025 is an international standard that governs calibration labs. It requires labs demonstrate that they operate a quality  management system that controls the processes and documentation, including auditing and corrective action processes. It also  requires adherence to rigorous technical requirements that ensure valid results are generated.  In terms of specific technical requirements, ISO/IEC 17025 ensures that a company:  • maintains testing facilities and equipment to specified standards  • ensures protocols are fully documented  • trains workers to an appropriate level of competence  • confirms validity and appropriateness of methods, especially so called “non-standard” methods such as those used to     calibrate laser measurement equipment, which have been developed internally  • uses accepted mathematical methods for calculating results  • verifies that purchased test equipment meets proper requirements, and that all equipment used to produce accredited     calibrations has itself received ISO 17025 accredited calibrations  • has a traceable path of calibration to independently maintained national or international standards  • provides both as received and outgoing testing data to customers in an approved format  • ensures the calibration certificate meets the requirements of the standard The outcome of all these efforts is that customers can have confidence that a laboratory achieves verifiably correct  results, and that these results will be reported in an unambiguous manner.Calibration and Service ISO 17025 Accreditation Calibration & Service', 'page_label: 141 file_path: catalog/laser-measurement-and-control-cat.pdf  139 •                 Toll Free: (800) 343-4912                 •                 Tel: (408) 764-4042                 •                 Fax: (503) 454-5727Limited Warranty Coherent, Inc., warrants to the original purchaser that its laser  power and energy meters and sensors are free from defects in  materials and workmanship and comply with all specifications,  active at the time of purchase, for a period of twelve (12) months.
