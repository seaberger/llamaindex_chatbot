      Actual events or results may differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. As such, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as
predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations
and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our
                                                                                              2

business, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strategy, and financial needs. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is
subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us
to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results,
events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
    In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on
information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these
statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or
review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.
    The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information, actual results, revised expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We
may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-
looking statements.

                                            NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     Description of Business
     Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a
technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.
Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects
consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers
(“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and
other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to
as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product
expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.
     Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia
(excluding China and Southeast Asia).
     Basis of Presentation
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
     In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the
financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.
     There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed
with the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.
     Basis of Consolidation
     Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and
voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.
     Use of Estimates
     The  preparation   of our  unaudited   condensed    consolidated  financial  statements   in conformity   with  GAAP     requires management     to  make   estimates  and
assumptions,   which   affect  the reported  amounts    in the  financial statements   and  accompanying     notes.  Estimates   are based   on  historical experience,  where
applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates,
including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of
amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation;
income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are
inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and
inputs  (including  market   data)  supporting   certain of  these  estimates,  assumptions    and  judgments,   in particular,  our  impairment   assessment    related to  the
determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of
uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the
pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and
additional information is obtained.
                                                                                       11

       Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19
       Various         governments             continue         to    implement,            lift,   and     in    some       regions        reinstate       restrictions,         including       business         activities        and     travel      restrictions.          These
restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the
growth of our Delivery offerings. COVID-19 has produced uncertainty around the world and it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and
ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on
our    business        and     financial        results      will    depend        largely       on    future      developments,              including         the    duration       of   the  spread       of   the    outbreak         and     any    resurgences            of   the
outbreak         or   variants        of   the    virus,      both     globally        and     within       the     United       States,      the     administration,            adoption       and     efficacy       of    vaccines         in   the    United        States      and
internationally, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether
the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
       Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
       In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,”
which       requires       disclosures          about       transactions          with     a   government            that    are    accounted           for   by    applying        a  grant    or   contribution           accounting           model       by    analogy. The
standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on
January 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
       In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts
with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if the
acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial
statements.
Note 2 – Revenue
       The      following          tables      present        our     revenues         disaggregated             by     offering        and     geographical            region.       Revenue        by    geographical             region       is   based       on    where        the
transaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected
by economic factors (in millions):

       (1)  We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (“Subscription”). We recognize Subscription fees
ratably over the life of the pass. We allocate Subscription fees earned to Mobility and Delivery revenue on a proportional basis, based on usage for each offering
during the respective period.

       Revenue
       Mobility Revenue
       We derive revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of our platform(s) and related services to facilitate and complete mobility services
and, in certain markets, revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform. Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue
streams such as our financial partnerships products.
                                                                                                                                            12

       During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility
services       to   end-users          in   those     markets. We             have      determined           that    in   these      transactions,          end-users         are    our     customers          and     our    sole     performance            obligation          in   the
transaction         is   to   provide        transportation           services        to   the    end-user. We             recognize         revenue        when       a   trip    is  complete.          In   these     markets         where       we     are    responsible          for
mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in
exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
       Delivery Revenue
       We      derive       revenue         for    Delivery          from      Merchants’            and      Couriers’         use     of    the    Delivery         platform          and     related       service       to    facilitate       and      complete          Delivery
transactions.
       Additionally,            in   certain       markets         where       we     are     responsible          for    delivery         services,        delivery        fees     charged        to    end-users         are    also     included         in    revenue,        while
payments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $88 million
and $241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive
of depreciation and amortization of $339 million and $740 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
       Delivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.
       Freight Revenue
       Freight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition
of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”), and as a result, our Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.
       All Other Revenue
       Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to our Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) business and revenue from
our New Mobility offerings and products.
       Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation
       Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, we had $155 million of contract
liabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized
from these contracts during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 was not material.

       During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
       We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2
instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using
market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted
market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.
       As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of
common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held
companies without readily determinable fair values.
       Depending            on     the    investee’s         financing         activity       in   a   reporting         period,       management’s              estimate         of   fair    value      may       be    primarily         derived       from       the    investee’s
financing         transactions,          such      as    the    issuance        of    preferred        stock      to    new      investors.        The      price     in   these      transactions           generally        provides         the    best     indication         of    the
enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by
using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market
data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in
this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.
       Once       the    fair    value      of   the    investee        is   estimated,         an    option-pricing             model       (“OPM”),           a   common           stock      equivalent         (“CSE”)          method         or   a  hybrid        approach         is
employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the
investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.
       An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could
result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and
volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the
future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.
       We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

      Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
      Non-Financial Assets
      Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized.
Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
      Non-Marketable Equity Securities
      Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-
marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the
measurement      alternative)  or  for impairment. Any      changes    in carrying   value   are recorded    within  other  income    (expense),   net  in the  condensed    consolidated
statement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these
securities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for
contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.
      We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

      MLU B.V. Investment
      We reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three
months ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182
million in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a
protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a
market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.
      MLU B.V. Basis Difference
      Included in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share
of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a
one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for
currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated
against the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying
value of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30,
2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.’s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.

     We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-
line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.
     MLU B.V. Call Option
     On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period
as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current
liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income
(expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to
certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.
     As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of
December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the
call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price
(Level 3).
     As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change
during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which
simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the
underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free
interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

     2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loans Refinancing
     On February 25, 2021, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $2.6 billion pursuant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured
Term Loan agreement, the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all previously outstanding loans under the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement and
the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement. The $2.6 billion is comprised of (i) a $1.1 billion tranche with a maturity date of February 25, 2027, replacing the
2016 Senior Secured Term Loan as a Refinancing Term Loan (the “2027 Refinanced Term Loan”), and (ii) a $1.5 billion tranche with a maturity date of April 4,
2025, replacing the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan as an Incremental Term Loan (the “2025 Refinanced Term Loan”). The refinancing transaction qualified as a
debt modification that did not result in an extinguishment.
     The 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2025
Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur
debt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022. The loan is secured by certain of our
intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.
     The fair values of our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2022 and
were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.
     2025 Convertible Notes
     In December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including
the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025
Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act.
The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.
     Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding September 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31,
2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%
of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement
period”) in which the trading price (as defined below) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of
the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call such notes for redemption, at any
time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified
corporate events. On or after September 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders
may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
                                                                                                 18
---
     As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the
2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.
     The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special
interest.
     Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and
shares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at
our option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at
least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and
including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
     The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the
incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.
     Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded
as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability
component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity
component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not
remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as
of the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.
     Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to
additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the
opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible
Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.
     The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active,
which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.
     Senior Notes
     The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries.
The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well
as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.
     The following table presents the fair values of our Senior Notes as of March 31, 2022, and were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not
active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input (in millions):

     Revolving Credit Arrangements
     We have a revolving credit agreement initially entered in 2015 with certain lenders, which provides for $2.3 billion in credit maturing on June 13, 2023
(“Revolving    Credit   Facility”). On April    4,  2022,  we   entered  into  an  amendment     to  our  Revolving    Credit  Facility  to, among    other  things,  (i) provide  for
approximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, (iii)
reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based interest rate with a
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit
agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit
agreement contains customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes,
as  well  as maintain   a  certain level  of  liquidity specified  in  the contractual   agreement. The     credit agreement    also  contains  customary    events  of  default. The
Revolving Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the payment of dividends. As of March 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit
Facility.
     Letters of Credit
     As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had letters of credit outstanding of $749 million and $741 million, respectively, of which the letters of credit
that reduced the available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility were $247 million and $239 million, respectively.

       (1)  During the three months ended March 31, 2021, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax relates to pre-tax unrealized gains of $1.3 billion
for the change in fair value of our investment in Grab. To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach,
incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special
purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on
contractual rights and preferences.

Note 8 – Stockholders' Equity
     Equity Compensation Plans
     We maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and other employees, directors, and
consultants: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the
2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have all been approved by stockholders. Following our IPO in 2019, we have only issued awards under
the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock
options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-
based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).

     The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Note 9 – Income Taxes
     We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the
quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact
related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022,
the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the
benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due
to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets,
and foreign tax rate differences.
     During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not
impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.
     We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign
tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in
which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For
our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom
(“UK”), and Australia.
     Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits
within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the
full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
     In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating
losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022.
Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.
Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share
     Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net
loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible
securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.
     We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using
the equity method.
                                                                                    24

       For     information           about       how      our     reportable         segments          derive      revenue,         refer     to   Note      2   –   Revenue.          Our      segment         operating         performance             measure        is   segment
adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.
Segment          adjusted        EBITDA           is   defined        as   revenue         less    the    following         expenses:          cost     of   revenue,         operations          and     support,        sales     and     marketing,          and    general        and

Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies
     Contingencies
     From time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and
March 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax
matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax
matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.
     We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent
contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair
competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”)
claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.
We   have  existing litigation, including class  actions, Private Attorney   General  Act  lawsuits, arbitration claims,  and  governmental    administrative  and  audit
proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California
State Assembly    Bill 5 (“AB5”),   we  have   received  and expect  to  continue  to receive  - in California  and  in other  jurisdictions - an increased  number    of
misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or
range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters
were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially
adversely affected.
     Driver Classification
     California Attorney General Lawsuit
     In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the
“ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers
performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s
control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of
business performed for the hiring entity.
     On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in
San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages
related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.
     On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating
various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a
petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November
2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.
     Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of
the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to
comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.
     The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate
proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a
                                                                                   27

stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with the trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the
preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of
Proposition  22.  We   have  petitioned  to stay this matter  pending   coordination   with  other California  employment    related  matters, which   was   granted  and  a
coordination judge was assigned. Since the assignment of the coordination judge, the case remains stayed as to discovery. We intend to continue to vigorously
defend ourselves. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.
     In addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is
unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the
Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with
the California Court of Appeal and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.
     Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit
     On July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers
are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in
which we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success on
the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.

     Several Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber
B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling
was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are
still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent
workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact
on our current operations. A ruling on the merits by the Federal Tribunal is expected in 2023. The ultimate resolution of the matters appealed before the Federal
Tribunal is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of March 31, 2022.
     Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.
     On October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that
they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The
tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of
the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at
the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.
     On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law
purposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.
     On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage
when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a
settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a
settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement
who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for
claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.
     On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the
enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these
matters within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.
     Other Driver Classification Matters
     Additionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,
administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We
believe that our current and historical approach to classification is
                                                                                     28

supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently
unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and
settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.
    State Unemployment Taxes
    In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes
of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both
Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from
2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised
amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain,
we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.
    Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski
    On October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of
their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to
compete with Google’s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March
26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million against
Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its
request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and
Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google
on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.
Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.
In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the
trade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to
perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was
formally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski’s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May
16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain given the possibility of appeals, we recorded for
this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.
    Non-Income Tax Matters
    We recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with
regard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as
the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve
the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on
payments made to such Drivers.
    We are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to
classify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we
charge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and
HMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be
classified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a
satisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may
require the up-front payment to the Tax Court (“pay-to-play”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious
defense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation
and is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussions
with HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.
    Our estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions,
therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.
                                                                                   29

     Other Legal and Regulatory Matters
     We have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices, compliance with
antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection
laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We have investigated many of these matters and we are implementing a
number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we
are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and
require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial
condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.
     Indemnifications
     In the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,
we  may   be  obligated  to indemnify   such  parties for losses  or claims  suffered  or incurred  in connection   with  their activities or non-compliance    with  certain
representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former
employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss
under these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.
Note 13 – Variable Interest Entities
     Variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.
     Consolidated VIEs
     We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct
the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these VIEs.
     Total assets included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 were $3.9 billion
and $4.2 billion, respectively. Total liabilities included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022
were $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
     Freight Holding
     As of March 31, 2022, we own the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding and report a non-controlling interest as further
described in Note 14 – Non-Controlling Interests.
     Careem Qatar
     The assets and operations in Careem Qatar had not been transferred to us as of March 31, 2022. Transfer of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar will be
subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval. We have rights to all residual interests in the Careem Qatar entity which is considered a variable
interest. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual
legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity.
     Unconsolidated VIEs
     We do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact   the entities’ economic   performance.   Our  carrying  amount    of assets recognized   on  the condensed   consolidated   balance  sheets  related to
unconsolidated VIEs was $598 million and $605 million as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively, and represents our maximum exposure to loss
associated with the unconsolidated VIEs.
     Lime
     Neutron Holdings, Inc. (“Lime”) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term
access use by consumers for personal transportation. On May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP
business and acquired ownership in Lime comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime
Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). We are exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards through our ownership of the 2020 Lime
Investments, which represent variable interests.
     Moove
     Garment Investments S.L. dba Moove (“Moove”) is a vehicle fleet operator in Spain. On February 12, 2021, we entered into and completed a series of
agreements with Moove including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, in which we acquired a
                                                                                     30
---
30% minority interest in Moove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on future performance of Moove and
certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a term loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial
partnership agreement. After this series of agreements, Moove is considered a related party. We are exposed to Moove’s economic risks and rewards through our
equity investment, the term loan and commercial partnership agreement, which represent variable interests.
Note 14 – Non-Controlling Interests
     Freight Holding
     As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we owned 78% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or 75% on a
fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and outstanding. The minority
stockholders of Freight Holding include: (i) holders of Freight Holding’s Series A and A-1 Preferred Stock; (ii) holders of common equity awards issued under the
employee equity incentive plans; and (iii) employees who hold fully vested shares.
Note 15 – Divestiture
     Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora
     On January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of
autonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of
the ATG Business transferred to Aurora.
     As consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated
Liquidation   Preference  of  $1.1 billion, which   had  previously  been   recorded  as redeemable    and  non-redeemable    non-controlling   interests on  our condensed
consolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the
form of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested
$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of
Aurora.
     We do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.
     We entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving
vehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue
to vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration
for these future obligations to Aurora.
     The sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does
not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this transaction.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, results of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. The resulting gain on disposal was recorded in
other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
     The following table presents the gain on sale of the ATG Business (in millions):
                                                                                                                                                  Three Months Ended

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion
contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-
looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements
and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the
forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
     Overview
     We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A
to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of
ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public
transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight
industry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.
     Driver Classification Developments
     The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are
involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before
administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as
workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,
2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco
Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the
alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.
     On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating
various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with
the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use
platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s
preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of
Proposition 22.
     In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,
which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County
Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California
Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.
     To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings
floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
     Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (“UK”) Employment
Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather
than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able
to take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed
to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.
     On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK
drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring
their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.
     On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage
when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a
settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical
                                                                                    32

claims         relating         to    their      classification              under        UK       law.       Our      portal        for     drivers        to    register         for     a   settlement            of     historical          holiday          pay      and      national          minimum              wage
liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made
payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the
tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.
         On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the
enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.
         If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we
would         incur        significant            additional            expenses            for     compensating                 Drivers,          including            expenses            associated             with       the     application             of    wage         and      hour       laws       (including

penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,
and      we      may       not      be     able      to    hire     a    majority           of    the     Drivers          currently           using       our      platform.           Any        of    these       events         could        negatively            impact          our      business,           result      of
operations, financial position, and cash flows.

         Highlights for the First Quarter 2022
         In the first quarter of 2022, our MAPCs were 115 million, declining 3 million, or 3%, quarter-over-quarter, but growing 17% compared to the same period in
2021. The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19,
followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022 with the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or
received a Delivery order on our platform increasing from 111 million in January 2022 to 121 million in March 2022.
                                                                                                                                                                33

     Overall Gross Bookings increased to $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, or 39% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2021.
Mobility Gross Bookings grew 62% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the
impacts of COVID-19. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 15% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, outpacing Delivery Trip growth, as we saw a 3% increase
in basket sizes globally driven by stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19.
     Revenue was $6.9 billion, up 136% year-over-year, with a Take Rate of 25.9%. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $1.5
billion increase in our Freight business due to the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) during the fourth quarter of 2021, the favorable impact to
revenue of $200 million due to a change in the accounting model for our UK Mobility business, as well as a favorable comparative impact to the same period in
2021 where, during the first quarter of 2021, revenue was reduced by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the
classification of drivers.
     Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $5.9 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity
securities, net of $5.6 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $1.9 billion unrealized loss on our Grab
investment; a $1.7 billion unrealized loss on our Aurora investments; a $1.4 billion unrealized loss on our Didi investment; and a $462 million unrealized loss on
our Zomato investment. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $359 million of stock-based compensation expense.
     Adjusted EBITDA was $168 million, up $527 million compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit improved by 107%, year-over-
year, to $618 million. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $30 million, up $230 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $200 million in the same period in
2021.
     We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
     Other Developments
     COVID-19
     In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has
rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities’ and
states’ declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other
measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility
rides. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to
be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
     COVID-19 Response Initiatives
     We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve. We are focused on
navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability
to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an
expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.
     To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended, our shared Mobility offering, in most
markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that
consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability.
     We are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous
uncertainties,  including  the  severity  of the  disease,  the duration   of the  outbreak,  any   future waves   or  resurgences   of  the virus,  variants of  the  virus, the
administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the
further impact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
                                                                                       34

Components of Results of Operations
    Revenue
    We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these
arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver
incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.
    During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility
services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the
transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for
mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in
exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
    For  additional  discussion related  to our revenue,  see  the section titled “Management’s    Discussion   and Analysis  of  Financial Condition   and  Results of
Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue
Recognition,” and “Note 2 - Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021 and Note 2 – Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
    Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization
    Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit
card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation
services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are
primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.
    We expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip
volume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located
data center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
    Operations and Support
    Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in
cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer
support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.
    As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an
absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.
    Sales and Marketing
    Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising
costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of
certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.
    As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the
foreseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.
    Research and Development
    Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and
product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We
expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.
    We expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and
development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a
decrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business.
                                                                                  35
---
      General and Administrative
      General   and   administrative    expenses    primarily    consist  of  compensation      costs,  including   stock-based     compensation,     for  executive    management      and
administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as
allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.
      As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an
absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal
support functions.
      Depreciation and Amortization
      Depreciation    and  amortization    expenses   primarily   consist   of depreciation    on  buildings,   site improvements,     computer    and   network   equipment,    software,
leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements,
computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our
capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.
      As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out
our network infrastructure and building locations.
      Interest Expense
      Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.
      Other Income (Expense), Net
      Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:
        •     Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.
        •     Foreign   currency    exchange    gains   (losses),  net,  which   consist   primarily   of  remeasurement      of  transactions   and   monetary    assets   and  liabilities

      Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
      We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax
rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will
vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and
changes in tax laws.
      Equity Method Investments
      Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was unfavorably impacted by a $600 million accrual
made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers. We also saw a $304 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting
from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets
where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, we saw a $200
million increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK.

        Segment Adjusted EBITDA
        Segment Adjusted                      EBITDA             is   defined         as    revenue          less     the     following           expenses:            cost    of    revenue,     exclusive    of    depreciation           and     amortization,              operations          and
support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA
also excludes non-cash items, certain transactions that are not indicative of ongoing segment operating performance and/or items that management does not believe
are    reflective          of    our      ongoing          core      operations.             For     additional           information,              see     Note       11    –   Segment       Information       and     Geographic            Information              in  the     notes     to    the

        Mobility Segment
        For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Mobility revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 195%, and Mobility
adjusted EBITDA profit increased $320 million, or 107%.
        Mobility revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the
impacts of COVID-19. Business model changes in the UK that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue also benefited Mobility revenue by $200
million. Additionally, Mobility revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK
relating to the classification of drivers.
                                                                                                                                                            41

     Mobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by a $281 million increase in insurance
expense as a result of an increase in miles driven and a $76 million increase in credit card processing costs.
     Delivery Segment
     For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Delivery revenue increased $771 million, or 44%, and Delivery
adjusted EBITDA grew $230 million, or 115%.
     Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 15%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in
food delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Take Rate improved to 18.1% from 14.0% compared to the same period in 2021 driven by an overall improvement in
basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are
recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.
     Delivery adjusted EBITDA improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by a $387 million increase in cost of
revenue as well as a $94 million increase in consumer promotions and employee headcount costs.
     Freight Segment
     For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Freight revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 506%, and Freight
adjusted EBITDA grew $31 million, or 107%.
     Freight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is
also driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.
     Freight adjusted EBITDA improvement is attributable to a $1.5 billion improvement in Freight revenue, partially offset by $1.4 billion of certain shipper
payments and incentives recorded in cost of revenue and an $88 million increase in employee headcount costs.
Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about how we use
these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
     Monthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery
order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our
platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of
transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.
                                                     Monthly Active Platform Consumers                 mtillions)

     Trips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX
Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a
useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.

       Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides;
Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue.
Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.

       Adjusted EBITDA was $168 million, improving $527 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $359 million in the same period in 2021. The improvement
was primarily attributable to a $320 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $230 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $31
million increase in Freight Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $65 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income
(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow,
which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to
evaluate    period-to-period    comparisons.    We    believe   that these   non-GAAP      financial   measures    provide   meaningful     supplemental     information    regarding   our
performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.
      We   believe  that  both  management      and  investors   benefit  from   referring  to  these  non-GAAP      financial  measures    in  assessing   our  performance    and   when
planning,   forecasting,   and  analyzing    future  periods. These    non-GAAP      financial   measures   also  facilitate management’s      internal  comparisons     to our  historical
performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key
metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help
them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in
understanding     and   evaluating   our  operating    results  in the  same    manner    as  our  management      team   and   board   of directors.   Our   calculation   of these   non-
GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
      Adjusted EBITDA
      We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)
attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest
expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory
reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)
restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related
payments     for  financial  assistance   to  Drivers   personally   impacted    by  COVID-19,      the  cost  of  personal   protective   equipment    distributed   to  Drivers,   Driver
reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and
others in need as well as charitable donations.
      We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our
operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that
Adjusted    EBITDA      provides   useful   information    to investors   and   others  in  understanding    and   evaluating   our  operating    results in  the  same   manner    as  our
management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of
certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations,
we are excluding the impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of
personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free
rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management
find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the
impact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.
      COVID-19 Response Initiatives
      To support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have
announced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of
personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free
rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers
personally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.
The cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need
as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.
      Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation
      Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related
financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:
       •   Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and
           although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not
           reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
                                                                                             44

        •   Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;
        •   Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring
            expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
        •   Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments
            for   financial    assistance     to  Drivers     personally     impacted      by   COVID-19,        the   cost   of   personal     protective    equipment       distributed     to  Drivers,    Driver
            reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors,
            and others in need as well as charitable donations;
        •   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;
        •   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange
            gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity
            securities; and
        •   Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.

      Constant Currency
      We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant
currency     growth     rate  information      to  provide    a  framework       for  assessing    how    our   underlying     revenue     performed      excluding     the   effect  of   foreign   currency     rate
fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for
our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
                                                                                                          45

      Operating Activities
      Net cash provided by operating activities was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $5.9 billion of net loss, adjusted
for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $5.6 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $359 million of stock-based compensation expense and
$254 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $27 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued
insurance reserves.
      Net cash used in operating activities was $611 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $122 million of net loss, adjusted for
certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion gain on business divestiture and $281 million of stock-based compensation expense as well as a $412
million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
      Investing Activities
      Net cash used in investing activities was $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million in purchases of property
and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.
      Net cash used in investing activities was $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $803 million in purchases of non-
marketable equity securities, $336 million in purchases of marketable securities and $216 million in purchases of a note receivable, partially offset by proceeds
from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $696 million and $500 million in proceeds from the sale of non-marketable equity securities.
      Financing Activities
      Net cash used in financing activities was $113 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million of principal payments
on finance leases.
      Net cash used in financing activities was $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $194 million of principal repayment
on Careem Notes.
      Other Information
      As of March 31, 2022, $2.2 billion of our $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States
may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial
tax   liabilities. We     believe   that   our  existing    cash   balance    in  the   United    States   is  sufficient   to  fund   our   working     capital   needs    in  the  United     States. We     are  in
compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of
funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital
requirements,       collateral   requirements,       potential    acquisitions,     potential    prepayments       of  contested     indirect   tax   assessments      (“pay-to-play”),      and    other   liquidity
requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity
during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact
to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
      Purchase Commitments
      As of March 31, 2022, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Estimates
      Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and
related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We
evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences
between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.
                                                                                                          47

     For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note
1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,
Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
     See Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
     We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency
risk as follows:
     Interest Rate Risk
     Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The
2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact
our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100
basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.
     The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining
in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million
as of March 31, 2022.
     Investment Risk
     Our  investment   policy  objective aims  to  preserve  capital and  meet  liquidity requirements   without   significantly increasing  risk. We  had  cash  and  cash
equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did
not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds
and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.
Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in
interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.
     We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and
recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value
given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These
investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair
value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of
time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.
     Foreign Currency Risk
     We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to
the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating
expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating
results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified
across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.
     We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement
of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency
rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into
derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
     We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive
                                                                                     48

Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange
Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable
assurance level.
      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      We acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are
reviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were
no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
      Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
      Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.
Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its
objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
                                                                        PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most
significant of these matters are described below.
Legal Proceedings Described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
      Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in
conjunction with Note 12 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:
      •    Driver Classification
      •    State Unemployment Taxes
      •    Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski
Legal    Proceedings     That   Are   Not   Described     in  Note   12  –  Commitments        and   Contingencies     to  Our    Unaudited     Condensed      Consolidated  Financial
Statements
      In addition to the matters that are identified in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter
ended March 31, 2022 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material
pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.
      Australia Class Actions
      In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of
certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the
period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The
claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of
certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny
these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.
      Other Legal Proceedings
                                                                                             49
---
      While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the
matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be
material   to  our  consolidated   results  of  operations   in any   one  accounting    period.  We   are  currently   involved   in, and  may    in the  future  be  involved  in, legal
proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related
to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where
we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in
which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government
investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and
interim rulings.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
      Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following
risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related
notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our
business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not
believe are material.
Risk Factor Summary
The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.
      •    The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our
           business.
      •    Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.
      •    The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,
           low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.
      •    To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,
           and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.
      •    We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase
           significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.
      •    If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other
           factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.
      •    Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and
           negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to
           maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
      •    Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these
           challenges may not be successful.
      •    If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be
           adversely affected.
      •    Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may
           harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.
      •    We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are
           inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.
                                                                                             50

      •    We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by

Risks Related to Our Business
General Economic Risks
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,
various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations
on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example,
by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions
around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility
                                                                                             51
---
offering may not recover to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and we are
observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, as such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by
concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, to support social
distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.
     The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required
and may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models
of our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do
not believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,
and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the
duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the
administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply
chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our
end-users’ behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
     In addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely
impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital
markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other
risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could
adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.
Operational Risks
Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.
     The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are
involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before
administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as
workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,
among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and
provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.
Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification
of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.
     In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)
arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual
settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal
proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively
impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.
     Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent
contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of
Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have
brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.
     In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like
ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent
contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to
dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating
to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be
filed.
                                                                                             52
---
     We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,
alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we
may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial
decisions,  we  are required  to classify Drivers   as employees,   we  would   incur significant  additional expenses   for compensating    Drivers,  including  expenses
associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social
security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional
costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have
adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority
of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have
an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
     Another  example   of  a recent  judicial decision  relating to Driver  classification is the Aslam,   Farrar, Hoy  and  Mithu   v. Uber  B.V.,  et al. ruling by  the
Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather
than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going
forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid
holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a
driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French
Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),
decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent
Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are
employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.
     In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers
becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of
Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt
our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.
     In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation
including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical
Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low
barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these
industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.
     Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are
highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and
Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers
to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to
shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other
merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of
orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.
     Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a
limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than
we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In
addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value
more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our
                                                                                    53

products. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform
users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.
      We face competition in each of our offerings, including:
         •     Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the
               markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In
               addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in
               many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including
               Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.
         •     Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for Drivers,
               consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.
               Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services,
               grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.
         •     Freight.  Our   Freight   offering  competes    with   global  and  North American       freight  brokers   such  as  C.H.   Robinson,    Total  Quality   Logistics,  XPO
               Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.
      Many of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products and
offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors
have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographic
market. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating
histories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more
quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render
our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation
victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.
      We are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China through
August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India with
respect to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-
scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes
with us in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe
and Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographic
markets. In addition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business,
including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.
      Additionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummate
them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or
part of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.
      For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively would
have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.
To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and
may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect
our financial performance.
      To remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service
fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,
we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a
Driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and
regions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts
and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and
promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer
                                                                                             54
---
discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance.
Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be
modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting
consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer
structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our
business may be adversely impacted.
     The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors
will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain
of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the
future. These  investments   or strategic transactions, along  with  other competitive   advantages  discussed  above,  may   allow  our competitors   to compete   more
effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,
merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or
maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively
nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.
We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase
significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.
     We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2021, and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease
proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be
able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we
continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and
promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire
additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in
increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase
revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to
add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower
service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a
negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to
additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or
maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to
achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North
Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.
If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other
factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.
     Our success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market
by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to
offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced
and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may
continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market,
we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that we experience
in that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of
carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific
geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack
a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become
less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other
merchants, and this
                                                                                   55

concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant
restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a
fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users
would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger network scale and
liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance
between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more important to service quality than the absolute
size of the network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors’ products achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a
quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.
    Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation
of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and
merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,
including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of
disease or similar public health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not
fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In
addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable
manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish or
maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality
support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and our
business would suffer.
    The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their
services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or
services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other
aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar
work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to
improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.
    Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be
viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security
breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and
merchants,  which   may  damage   our  relationships with  platform  users or  discourage  or diminish  their use  of our platform.  Further, we  are  investing in our
autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted
in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may
result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our
network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or
carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.
    In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to
our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,
prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make
deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to
provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially
different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an
efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any
changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required
to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in
certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The
failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing
periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.
                                                                                   56

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and
negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain
or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
     Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the
engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse
platform user sentiment.
     We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled
distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it
difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,
and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased
their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.
     In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have
occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety
incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue
to result in positive  and  negative  media  coverage   and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny and  could  adversely   affect our reputation  with  platform  users. Further
unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and
becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could
have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and
Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm
to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.
     Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain
divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain
contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,
and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we
announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,
merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the
law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result
in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.
     While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a
good  reputation,  minimizing   the number   of  safety incidents, continuing   an improved   culture  and  workplace   practices, improving   our compliance   programs,
maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and
media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their
offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our
brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and
reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.
Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these
challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
     Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in
the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally.
Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote
transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating
results, and prospects.
     Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,
causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we
                                                                                    57

have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally
managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated or managed to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although
we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such reorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our
company.
Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If we
are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future
prospects will be adversely affected.
     Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and
has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and
internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect
our operating results.
     As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31,
2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States to
increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including
engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires
perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing
employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in
workforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions
in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in
workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult
for us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly
managing our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could
likewise harm our business.
     Our failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow
response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve
the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls
over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our
transaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with
respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving
risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current
and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire
additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or
carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and operating results.
     Our organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products
and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our
reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in
these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive
challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.
If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract
and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial
condition, and operating results.
     We are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable
to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Such
actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or
significant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through
third-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain
jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose
information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the
                                                                                    58
---
qualification and  background    check  standards  for Couriers  are generally  less extensive  than  those  conducted  for  Mobility  Drivers.  In addition, we  do  not
independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or
threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification
processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.
     If Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as
a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of
our business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and
allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise
engaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct while
using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of
violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of
Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other
criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed,
and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
     Public reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,
whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.
     Further, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,
or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face
litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the
growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and
face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven
roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,
need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours, all of
which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are
exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our
operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant
costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.
We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently
risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.
     We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new
technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several
countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,
which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary
Uber  Freight  acquired  Transplace,  expanding   Uber  Freight’s  business  through  Transplace’s  expertise  in transportation  management.    We  also  plan to invest
significant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our
development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.
Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have
limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,
but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.
     There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives
will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is
also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts
with respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our
more established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or
                                                                                   59

technologies, regulatory authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from
successfully    commercializing     new   products,   offerings  or  technologies.   If we   do  not  realize  the expected    benefits  of  our  investments,   our  business,   financial
condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.
Our business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are
unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.
      As of March 31, 2022, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 75% of all Trips. We
have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to
expand our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be
successful and may negatively affect our operating results.
      Conducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same
degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:
         •     operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;
         •     the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation
               of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;
         •     laws  and  regulations   more   restrictive  than  those   in the  United   States, including    laws  governing    competition,   pricing,  payment    methods,    Internet
               activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,
               payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and
               background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,
               ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;
         •     competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing
               relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;
         •     differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;
         •     differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;
         •     exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;
         •     legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a
               lack of clear legal precedent;
         •     difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor
               unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;
         •     fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
         •     managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;
         •     regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the
               same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;
         •     adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of
               earnings;
         •     increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;
         •     difficulties in  implementing      and  maintaining    the  financial   systems   and   processes   needed    to  enable   compliance    across   multiple   offerings   and
               jurisdictions;
         •     import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;
         •     political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in
               general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;
                                                                                             60
---
         •     public health concerns or emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of
               which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and
         •     reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.
      These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.
      Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with
and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy
has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our
competitors    in  those  lines  of businesses. As    a  result, a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes   minority   ownership    positions,  including   in  Didi,  Grab,  our
Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.
      Our ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of
Didi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi and
Zomato. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-
day management of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi
joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these
companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally,
these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets
throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and
prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.
      Any material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these
assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect
such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could
adversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies
have limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited
public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular
economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are
domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts
of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on
the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive
positions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint
venture, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader
consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions
between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks
could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our
common stock.
      Further, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial public
offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market for
any of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a
time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would
not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.
Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.
                                                                                             61

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely
affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.
      Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of
factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.
For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and
typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain
cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our
revenue    in the  first and   fourth  quarters   compared    to  the  second   and  third  quarters,  although    the historical  growth    of  Delivery   has  masked    these  seasonal
fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of
Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult
to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal
trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as
a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our
operations    in new   and  existing   markets,   our  ability to  maintain   an  adequate   growth    rate and   effectively  manage    that  growth,   our  ability to  keep  pace   with
technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,
and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense
levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and
investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our
expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their
investment.
If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results
and future prospects.
      Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they
will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and
our ability to:
         •     grow supply and demand on our platform;
         •     increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
         •     continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
         •     provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
         •     expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
         •     compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
         •     develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
         •     identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
         •     penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
         •     reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public
               transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
         •     maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
         •     enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,
               Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
         •     increase positive perception of our brand.
      We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming
from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier
demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,
                                                                                             62

failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased
revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we
cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.
We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large
metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely
impacted.
     In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo
in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives
and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are
susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious
diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in
which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics
or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,
or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater
degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect
our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew
existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such
metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating
results.
     Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,
the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural
areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would
be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.
     In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our
operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from
airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and
from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related
Mobility   and   reduce  our  Mobility   Gross   Bookings    from   airport trips. Certain   airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing   within  airport  boundaries,   including   by
mandating     that ridesharing   service  providers   obtain   airport-specific  licenses,  and   some   airports,  particularly  those  outside   the United   States,  have   banned
ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the
requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against
us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our
operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-
imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we
have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport
boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar
agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.
If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such
technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-
autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.
     We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our
platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment
in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-
driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which
we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,
                                                                                           63
---
including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either
alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or
logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could
introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora
or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their
technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to
leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of
autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such
services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our
competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.
     Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle
technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability
for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,
and operating results.
     Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These
regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,
we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to
offer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could
become subject to substantial fines or penalties.
Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could
adversely affect our business.
     Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high
demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and
workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.
Our employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our “return to office” plan,
which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges
maintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or
limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19
more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and
social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity
could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.
     Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior
management or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and
employees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.
     In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have
entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our business
differently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,
operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.
     In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition
into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating
results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel
transitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and
years of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business
prospects could be adversely affected.
     To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to
                                                                                    64
---
attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivate
employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent
with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition,
and operating results could be adversely affected.
The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.
     Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on
discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage
markets,  taxation, energy  prices,  interest rates, consumer  confidence,   and  other macroeconomic     factors. Consumer    preferences  tend  to shift to lower-cost
alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use
one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public
transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity
and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the
merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases
from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at
many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products
and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or
alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.
Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.
     Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used
vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may
continue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,
increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain
international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these
increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these
increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants
to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of
Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.
If we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary
or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.
     We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ license
numbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are an
attractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,
alteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and
brand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise
process some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,
acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.
     Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizable
until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may be
vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures
may misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise
damage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or
                                                                                   65
---
mitigate the impact of any such breaches, including potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.
     Security breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental
investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data
security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an
employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016,
outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the
names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information
on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state
Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks
related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and
regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for
breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had
been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem
becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we
experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been
subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final
court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or
other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business
disruption, and significant liabilities.
If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may
fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.
     To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of
new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For
example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about
rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further
strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.
     Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features
depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new
or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in
California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and
adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do
not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our
operating results.
We   track  certain  operational   metrics  and   our  category   position  with  internal  systems   and  tools, and   our  equity  stakes  in minority-owned     affiliates with
information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to
inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
     We track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems and tools,
and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by any third
party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which
we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in
unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use to
track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these
numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in
measuring how our products are
                                                                                        66
---
used across large populations globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of
Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the
data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our
estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not
perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material
inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.
In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and
safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other
adverse financial and accounting consequences.
     In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow
consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).
In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in
which Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many
jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply
with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those
jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for
Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety
incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of
these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.
     In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may
continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash
received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always
effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot
guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a
variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,
we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection
failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our
financial performance.
Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
     In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly
limit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry
(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed
by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other
network operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card
network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may
reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any
deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,
even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new
operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to
violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive
incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons,
or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and
operating results.
Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,
                                                                                    67

business, and operating results.
    We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and
mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information
technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,
including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,
viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats
are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated
cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of
our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive
position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely
affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.
    Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,
issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or
breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain
access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective
manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the
types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to
develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and
security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example,
software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we
may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and
availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and
result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers,
consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.
Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.
    Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent
upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the
future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our
software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions
between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the
availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that
could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such
as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users
may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release
of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs,
or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for
Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of
platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial
results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or
automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or
others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions,
predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or
reputational harm.
                                                                                   68

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely
impacted.
     We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon
business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration
of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party
suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to
maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of
vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers
may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted
in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we
experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.
We  have  made   climate  related  commitments    that require  us  to invest significant  effort, resources, and  management     time  and  circumstances   may   arise,
including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
     We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net
zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets
environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards
our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our
control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to
dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is
dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the
availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to
meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have
an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.
Dependencies on Third Parties
The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our
control.
     Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet
infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and
offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt
to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and
may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications
operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to
significantly decrease.
     Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a
power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and
platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,
and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and
subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new
products  to mitigate  the impact  of potential  interruptions to mobile  communications    systems,  which   can  be used  by  consumers   in territories where  mobile
communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.
We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.
If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
     Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for
download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform
                                                                                   69
---
will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that
iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target
those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our
advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and
offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping
solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all
mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties
cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or
reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be
more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.
Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.
     One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our
platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform
across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may
not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether
due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.
We rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or
unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.
     The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for
elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to
renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on
acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and
other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased
fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us.
If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
     In addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have
caused  substantial Driver  dissatisfaction and  generated   a significant number   of  Driver  complaints.  Future  failures of the payment    processing  infrastructure
underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality
or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to
Drivers, merchants, and carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition
would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.
We currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services
from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.
     We use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical
operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data
centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be
vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our
systems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service
providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require
us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of
data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch
to another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center
providers are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities
have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially
                                                                                    70
---
reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the
provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and
offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and reduce use of our platform by
consumers and shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe
our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our
ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.
Our use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.
    We use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source
software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be
subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing
terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to
make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor
our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source
license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of
such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source
software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such
licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions
of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.
    In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-
source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present
additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our
platform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects
becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be
unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial
condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.
Financing and Transactional Risks
We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
    To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,
and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,
and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt
instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and
other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our
existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing
on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support
our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.
We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may
limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.
    As of March 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $234 million of
Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of March 31, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing
and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur
additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.
                                                                                   71
---
     We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce
the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working
capital, capital expenditures,  expansion   plans, and  other  investments,  which  may   in turn  limit our ability to implement    our business  strategy, heighten  our
vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and
the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow
from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to
fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash
from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.
     In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,
including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the
payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising
activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities,
including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our
ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.
     In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”
We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
     The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, we
may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other
multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.
Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe
additional taxes.
     Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed
to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters
are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject
to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play
payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.
     Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for
valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future
income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,
regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and
currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial
position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by
our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from
the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our
tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,
which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing
licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our
licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain
jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial
statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.
                                                                                    72
---
Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
     We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,
and modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and
regulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well
as interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), any of which could lessen or
increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and
local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,
the Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these
expenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision
will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely
impacted by this legislation.
     We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our
business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that
we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where
we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential
changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could
become subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental
bodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and
historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax
obligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding
scale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our
financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
     As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and
$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January
1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,
we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss
carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future
income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation
undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s
ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research
tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership
change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our
ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to
limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
     Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated
financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of
depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect
our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity
may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have
limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.
If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we
acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
     As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies,
                                                                                           73
---
form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or
technologies, including our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem,
Cornershop, Postmates, Drizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if
we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive
approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.
      Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.
We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of
available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt
securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate
and   execute   acquisitions   or other  strategic  transactions   successfully    or fail to  successfully   address   any  of  these  risks, our  business,   financial  condition,   and
operating results may be harmed.
      In addition,   any  businesses    we  acquire   may   not  perform    as  well  as  we  expect.   Failure  to  manage    and   successfully   integrate  acquired   businesses    and
technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and
expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies
regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and
doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing
significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquired
company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:
         •     diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;
         •     disrupting our ongoing business operations;
         •     platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;
         •     implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;
         •     integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;
         •     retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural
               differences   between    acquired   businesses   and   our  business,   as  well  as  managing    costs  associated    with  eliminating   redundancies     or  transferring
               employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;
         •     maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;
         •     integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;
         •     integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;
         •     liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;
         •     litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and
         •     impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.
      We have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions. For example,
with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and
each company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive
Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or
reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.
      In addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws outside the United
States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,
and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.
      We may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether
                                                                                             74

these transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other
strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our
reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.
Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business
We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our
business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
     In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has
been blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such
jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements
or risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or
legislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an
existing license or permit.
     Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us
to comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January
2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be
picked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission
implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in
New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations
have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council
voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire
vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In
August 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruising
cap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.
Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in
November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect
on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In
addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January
1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to
negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in
countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.
     In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that
we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease
operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our
business operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used
the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal
challenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our
financial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled
that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched
Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in
certain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and
offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to
continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this
practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our
licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future
continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision
as a gesture of
                                                                                    75

goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers’ defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars. Furthermore, such business
practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue.
In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to
favor  local or incumbent   competitors,   including  obstacles for potential  Drivers  seeking  to obtain  required  licenses or vehicle  certifications. In addition, an
increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our
Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business
model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and
other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.
Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
     As of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes
conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,
and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.
Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we
operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be
adopted.
     Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and
regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical
transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-
market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that
limit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively
challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing
services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb
air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the
institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effect
in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition
to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to
have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to
share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance
with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on
either a temporary or indefinite basis.
     Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK
represented approximately 8.9% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.
     In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest
the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform
users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related
to, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product
liability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court
of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of
Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.
These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in
financial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which
could harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,
revenue, and operating results.
     In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to
dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other
Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers
                                                                                    76
---
using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less
sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or
material  defects in  current or future  dockless  e-bikes  or e-scooters  available  via our  app  could  result in negative  publicity, market  withdrawals,   regulatory
proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
     Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing
competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly
surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of
anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too
high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our
business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or
fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.
     In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose
significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including
limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,
therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
operating results.
     We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus
on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an
investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit
our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
     Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that
certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our
subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money
institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money
remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber
Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We
continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support
the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business
operations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or
limit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other
enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are
required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may
block payments to Drivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and
involve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
     Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to
Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate
each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our
platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our
platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,
and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not
completing all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received
by those users. A substantial
                                                                                    77
---
increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
     In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment
processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined
with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments
regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money
laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective
July 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the
European payments regulations.
     In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money
transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds
transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export
restrictions. Our  business  operations, including  our  payments   to Drivers  and  merchants,   may  not  always  comply   with  these  financial laws  and  regulations.
Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or
other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our
ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.
     Further, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,
and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering
and  sanctions  laws,  and in  the EEA   to  conduct  appropriate  risk assessments   and  implement   appropriate  controls  as a  regulated  financial service  provider.
Government    authorities may   seek  to bring  legal action against  us  if our payment   system   is used for  improper  or  illegal purposes  or if our  enterprise risk
management or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our
business.
We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and other
U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.
     We are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other government
agencies, including state AG offices in the United States and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including
our business practices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, data privacy and security incidents, as well as data deletion and document retention policies
related to the 2016 Breach, which involved the breach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and
downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various
lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and
payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent
decree  that lasts through   2038  covering   the  2014  Breach   and  the  2016  Breach   with  the U.S.  Federal   Trade  Commission    (the  “FTC”),   which   the FTC
Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million
related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and may continue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation
from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the
California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal
information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to
fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued
negative  publicity  and  an erosion  of  current and  prospective   platform  users’ trust, could  severely  disrupt our  business. In  addition, in  March   2022,  Uber
Technologies,   Inc. and  Uber   BV  were   each  fined €2.12   million by  the  Italian data protection  authority  for alleged  privacy  violations  stemming   from   an
investigation conducted in 2018.
     We are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other
countries.
     These government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior
management. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to
change our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional
reputational harm, and could result in or
                                                                                    78

complicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct investigations. Any of these developments could
result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.
We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,
legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
     The nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.
These and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws. Such
violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory
entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the
subject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant
to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we
protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,
future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately
$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a
settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,
we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved
payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and
Uber BV were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.
Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that
may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April
2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain
personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security
incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and
significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal
information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly
becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data
security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not
cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.
     This  risk is enhanced   in certain  jurisdictions with  stringent privacy  laws  and,  as we   expand  our  products,  offerings, and  operations   domestically  and
internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy
and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for
controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of
personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of
personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The
GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special
categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated
individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and
harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant
penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other
jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs
and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and
new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action
against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.
states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil
provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.
These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights
Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020.
                                                                                     79

     Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data
outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received
heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the
adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.
If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer
personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement
for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or
perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in
the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with
certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,
and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions
to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a
temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation
such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner
in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.
     Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus
compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,
disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived
failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by
individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if
found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If
any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.
Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our
ability to operate our business.
     We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal
proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are
subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual
property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such
litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time
consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal
proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to
change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
     In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process
for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become
more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to
our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future
voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our
litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by
platform users and employees.
     Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules
between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of
protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we
could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly
lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
                                                                                   80

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,
investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.
     We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA
and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to
additional  compliance   requirements   to identify  criminal  activity and  payments   to sanctioned   parties. Our  activities in certain countries  with  high  levels of
corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or
business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our
acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be
familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and
compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held
responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the
identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.
Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our
platform.
     Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in
which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific
region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be
licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers
may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of
licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations
that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become
subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.
     We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract
Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual
plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages
from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,
we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In
connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to
defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative
publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these
practices.
Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance
carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects
of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.
     We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our
Mobility  products   may  include  third-party  automobile,  automobile   comprehensive     and  collision, physical damage,   and  uninsured   and  underinsured   motorist
coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a
limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot
guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other
automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general
liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner
unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and
Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant
additional costs.
                                                                                     81
---
     In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the
risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our
insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by
us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and
industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have
requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.
     We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who
use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings
on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability
insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to
have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result
in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid
claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative
publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
     In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by
governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.
Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service
providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with
us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in
proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative
publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.
We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.
     Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have
been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate
consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.
Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.
Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the
subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings
(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of
municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a
result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of
others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
     Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware
designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent
applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we
do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue
our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.
     To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,
and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as
appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,
and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may
not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be
                                                                                   82
---
available in every country in which we currently or in the future will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our
products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties
from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and
other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be compromised by third parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive
advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we may be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect
such violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any
such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our
intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to
compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
     Companies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,” seeking to profit from
royalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and
frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to
receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights.
     Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not operated, which could increase
our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may
in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have
an interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investment
may materially decline.
     Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management’s
attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may
result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse
outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.
     We may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.
We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and
expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing
aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results
could harm our operating results.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.
     The accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business
model,  interpretations  of relevant  accounting  principles, enforcement    of existing or  new  regulations,  and  changes   in SEC   or other  agency  policies, rules,
regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial
statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in
materially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting
controls.
If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.
     The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their
business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” under the
Investment   Company Act     because  we  are primarily  engaged   in a  non-investment   company   business. Although    a significant portion  of our  assets constitute
investments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as minority-owned affiliates, we believe
that we are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an
investment   company,   such  a determination   would  require  us to  initiate burdensome   compliance   requirements   and  comply   with restrictions imposed   by  the
Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have
an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject
                                                                                    83
---
us to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our
assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,
and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or
part of your investment.
      The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,
including:
         •     actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial results;
         •     announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;
         •     variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;
         •     changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;
         •     actions  of  securities  analysts  who   initiate  or maintain   coverage    of  us, changes    in financial  estimates   by  any   securities  analysts  who   follow   our
               company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
         •     announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or
               capital commitments;
         •     negative media coverage or publicity;
         •     changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, including our
               competitors;
         •     price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;
         •     lawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us;
         •     developments     in legislation   or regulatory   actions,  including   interim   or  final rulings  by   judicial or  regulatory   bodies   (including   any  competition
               authorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more
               markets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company’s assets or businesses in one or more markets);
         •     changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;
         •     any major change in our board of directors or management;
         •     any safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;
         •     statements, commentary, or opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings by
               judicial or regulatory bodies; and
         •     other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as the
               current COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.
      In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices. Often, their
stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class
action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and
federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in
connection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and
seriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and
there can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose
some or all of your investment.
Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or
proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.
                                                                                             84
---
      Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common
stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem
advantageous. These provisions include the following:
         •     our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or
               removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
         •     advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
         •     limitations  on  stockholder    ability  to convene    special  stockholder    meetings,   which   could   make    it difficult for  our  stockholders    to adopt  desired
               governance changes;
         •     prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
         •     our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of
               directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
      Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or
deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the
price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject
to certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these
and other provisions, see the risk factor titled “-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment
obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.”
Sales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.
      Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress the
market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may issue our shares of common
stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments
or otherwise. Such issuances, including the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial
dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
      We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of
our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments include
restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our
common stock increases.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal
district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our
stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
      Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following
types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:
         •     any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
         •     any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
         •     any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and
               restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;
         •     any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;
         •     any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and
         •     any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.
                                                                                             85
---
     This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts
have exclusive jurisdiction.
     Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for
resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of
the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts
in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.
     These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our
directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent
jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may
incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.
General Risk Factors
     As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure
to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
     We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.
     The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and
challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size
and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required
for a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
     We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth
offerings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain
internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to
conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market
price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC
or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other
effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.

in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result

        2.29.   “Share” means each share of the Company’s common stock issued under an RSU Award.
        2.30.   “Subsidiary” means any corporation (other than the Company) in an unbroken chain of Entities beginning with the
Company if each of the corporation other than the last corporation in the unbroken chain owns stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one of the other corporation in such chain.
3.      Eligibility
Directors are eligible to participate in the Program. Any individual who ceases to be eligible to participate in the Program shall continue
to be a Participant with respect to amounts previously converted into RSU Awards until amounts payable under the RSU Awards are
completely   distributed  to the  Participant  in accordance    with  the Program.    By  making   an  RSU    Election, the  Director  shall for all
purposes be deemed conclusively to have consented to the provisions of the Program and the Equity Plan.
4.      Election to Convert Compensation Into RSU Award
        4.1.    RSU Election. A Director may elect to convert a designated percentage of any or all of the Director’s Compensation for
services performed in a calendar year (including Compensation that would otherwise be paid in the subsequent calendar year) into an
RSU Award (“RSU Election”), by properly completing and filing an RSU Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator.
Each RSU Election shall become irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making an RSU Election under Section
4.2, and cannot be modified for any reason thereafter. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, an RSU Election applies solely
with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in the calendar year specified in the RSU Election Form and does not
apply with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in any other calendar year.
                                                                         4
---
        4.2.    Timing of RSU Election.
                4.2.1. Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar
year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at
such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
                4.2.2. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of
the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make an RSU Election for services performed in the
calendar year on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the
Program. The RSU Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to Compensation earned with respect to services performed after
the later of (a) the Effective Date, (b) the date on which the RSU Election Form is received by the Administrator, or (c) such later date
as specified by the Administrator in the RSU Election Form.
        4.3.    Effect of RSU Election. On each date that Compensation would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the portion of the
Compensation subject to the RSU Election (to the extent not subject to a Deferral Election) shall be converted from cash into an RSU
Award by dividing the dollar amount subject to the RSU Election by the average daily closing price per Share of the Company’s
common stock in the month prior to the Conversion Date to determine the number of Shares underlying the RSU Award, with any
fractional Share rounded up to the next whole Share.
        4.4.     Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award. To the extent not subject to a Deferral Election, and unless otherwise specified
by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying an RSU Award shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as
soon as administratively practicable after the Conversion Date, but in any event within 60 days following the Conversion Date.
        4.5.    RSU Award Subject to Terms of Equity Incentive Plan. RSU Awards made under this Section 4 (including, for
purposes of clarification, such RSU Awards that are subject to a Deferral Election) shall be issued under the Equity Plan. As such, RSU
Awards and any Award Agreements governing them are subject to the Equity Plan’s terms, including, by way of example and not
limitation, the Equity  Plan’s  terms  regard  tax  withholding, restrictions on  awards   and  Shares   (including  clawback/recovery),   and
corporate events.
5.      Election to Defer RSUs
        5.1.    Deferral Election. A Director may elect to defer the issuance of a designated percentage of any or all of the Shares
underlying an RSU Award (a “Deferral Election”), with such number of Shares rounded up to the next whole Share, by properly
completing and filing a Deferral Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator. Each Deferral Election shall become
irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making a Deferral Election under Section 5.2, and cannot be modified for
any reason thereafter, except as provided in Section 5.4 below. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, a Deferral Election
applies solely with respect to (a) Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation payable for services that are performed in the
calendar   year  specified  in the  Deferral Election  Form   and   does  not  apply  with  respect  to Converted    RSU   Awards   related  to
Compensation
                                                                       5
---
payable for services performed in any other calendar year, or (b) the RSU Award specified in the Deferral Election Form, in the case of
a Non-Converted RSU Award. In the Administrator’s discretion, the RSU Election Form and the Deferral Election Form may be set forth
in the same document.
        5.2.    Timing of Deferral Election.
                5.2.1. With respect to a Converted RSU Award, a Director must make a Deferral Election with respect to Compensation
payable for services performed in a calendar year at the same time that an RSU Election for this Compensation may be made
pursuant to Section 4.2.
                5.2.2. With respect to a Non-Converted RSU Award, generally, a Deferral Election must be made on or before the
December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year in which the Non-Converted RSU Award is to be issued to the Director. If an
individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective
Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make a Deferral Election with respect to the Non-Converted RSU Award on or before
the date that is 30 days after the later of (a) the Effective Date, or (b) the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to
participate in the Program. The Deferral Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to the portion of the Non-Converted RSU
Award   earned   with respect  to  services  performed   on  or after the  date  on  which  the Deferral  Election  Form   is received  by  the
Administrator.
        5.3.    Form of Issuance. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, a Participant may, in the Deferral Election Form,
designate that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs will be issued in either (i) a single payment or (ii) three annual installments
over three years. A Participant may designate a different form of issuance with respect to each RSU Award for which the Participant
makes a Deferral Election. If and to the extent that a Participant does not designate the form of issuance in the Deferral Election Form,
the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs pursuant to that Deferral Election Form shall be issued as a single payment.
        5.4.    Re-deferral Election. In the Administrator’s sole discretion, a Participant may elect to postpone the date of issuance of
the Deferred RSUs under Section 6.2 by making an election in the form and manner specified by the Administrator (“Re-deferral
Election”). A Re-deferral Election is permissible only if it defers issuance of the underlying Shares for at least five years from the year
of the originally scheduled issuance date, does not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the Re-deferral Election
is made, and otherwise complies with Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(b) or its successor. In the event of a Corporate Transaction or
the Participant’s Disability or death, however, the underlying Shares shall be issued pursuant to Section 6.3, without regard to any Re-
deferral Elections.
6.      Issuance of Shares under Deferred RSUs
        6.1.    Issuance Upon Termination of Service. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the
Shares underlying a Participant’s Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect
to annual   installments)  in the form   designated   by the  Participant  as soon   as  administratively  practicable after  the Participant’s
termination of service, but in any case within 90 days following the date of termination of service. The Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall determine whether a Participant has terminated from service and the effective date of such termination.
                                                                       6
---
            6.2.        In-Service Distribution. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement and notwithstanding
Section 6.1, a Participant may elect on the Participant’s Deferral Election Form that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs shall be
issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the
Participant        on   or   as    soon      as   administratively           practicable         after    the    in-service       distribution        date     designated          by   the    Participant        in   the
Deferral Election Form; provided, however, that such date is after the third anniversary of the date of the Deferral Election Form, and
that if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the in-service distribution date, the Shares shall be
issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) on or about the May 16 following
the termination of service (or such other date as may be specified by the Administrator in accordance with Section 409A of the Code).
            6.3.        Annual        Installments.            Unless        otherwise         specified        by    the    Administrator           in   an    Award        Agreement,           after     the    initial
installment        of   Shares        is  issued,       all  subsequent           installment         of   Shares       shall     be    issued      in   each      subsequent           calendar        year     on    the
anniversary of the date upon which the initial installment of Shares was issued under Section 6.1. Each annual installment shall be
calculated by dividing the number of Shares covered by the Deferred RSUs divided by three; provided, however, that if the foregoing
would produce fractional Shares, the number of Shares covered under an RSU Award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
Share      and     the   fractional       Share      will   be    accumulated           so    that   the    resulting       whole      Share(s)        will  be    included       in   the   number        of   Shares
covered by the final installment.
            6.4.        Accelerated Issuance Upon Corporate Transaction, Disability, or Death. Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and
unless      otherwise         specified       by    the   Administrator           in  an    Award       Agreement,           upon      the    occurrence          of   a   Corporate         Transaction          or   the
Participant’s Disability or death, the Shares underlying all Deferred RSUs shall be issued in a single payment to the Participant (or the
Participant’s beneficiary under Section 6.5, as applicable) as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable event, but in case
within 90 days following the applicable event.
            6.5.        Beneficiary. A Participant may designate a beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary in the form and manner specified
by   the Administrator. Any                beneficiary         designation         hereunder          shall    remain       effective      until   properly       changed         or   revoked. A         beneficiary
designation may be changed by the Participant at any time before the Participant’s death by filing a new designation in writing with the
Administrator. If the Participant dies without having designated a beneficiary in accordance with this Section 6.5 or if the Participant
dies    and     the    beneficiary        so    designated         by    the    Participant        has    predeceased            the    Participant        or   otherwise        ceased        to   exist,    then     the
Participant’s estate shall be deemed to be the beneficiary.
            6.6.        Vesting and Issuance of Shares. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares
underlying        RSU Awards             representing           Deferred        RSUs       shall    be    fully   vested,       and    shall     be   issued       on    or   as   soon      as   administratively
practicable after the applicable issuance date under this Section 6, but no later than March 15  of the calendar year following the                             th
calendar       year     containing         the   applicable         issuance        date     (or,   in  the    case      of  death,      no    later    than     December          31    of   the    calendar        year
following the calendar year in which the Participant died).
7.          Nature of Participant’s Interest In Deferred Compensation Under the Program
                                                                                                             7
---
        7.1.    No Right to Assets. Participation in the Program does not create, in favor of any Participant, any right or lien in or
against any asset of the Company. Nothing contained in the Program, and no action taken under its provisions, will create or be
construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between the Company and a Participant or any other person. The
Company’s promise to pay benefits under the Program will at all times remain unfunded as to each Participant, whose rights under the
Program are limited to those of a general and unsecured creditor of the Company.
        7.2.    No  Right   to Transfer   Interest. Rights  to  benefits payable   under  the  Program   are  not  subject  in any  manner   to
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance. However, the Administrator may recognize the right of an alternate
payee named in a domestic relations order to receive all or part of a Participant’s benefits under the Program, but only if (a) the
domestic relations order would be a “qualified domestic relations order” within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code (if Section
414(p) applied to the Program), (b) the domestic relations order does not attempt to give the alternate payee any right to any asset of
the Company, (c) the domestic relations order does not attempt to give the alternate payee any right to receive payments under the
Program at a time or in an amount that the Participant could not receive under the Program, and (d) the amount of the Participant’s
benefits under the Program are reduced to reflect any payments made or due to the alternate payee.
        7.3.    No Service Rights. No provisions of the Program and no action taken by the Company or the Administrator will give
any person any right to be retained in the service of the Company, and the Company specifically reserves the right and power to
terminate the service of any Participant for any reason or no reason and at any time.
8.      Administration, Interpretation, and Modification of Program
        8.1.    Program Administrator.      The Administrator    will administer all aspects  of  the Program. The Administrator’s     powers
include, but are not limited to, the power to adopt rules consistent with the Program, the power to determine requirements and
limitations applicable to RSU Elections and Deferral Elections (including, without limitation, additional restrictions as to the minimum or
maximum     designated   percentage    or as  to  the in-service  distribution date),  the  power   to decide   all questions  relating to  the
interpretation of the terms and provisions of the Program, and the power to resolve all other questions arising under the Program
(including, without limitation, the power to remedy possible ambiguities, inconsistencies, or omissions by a general rule or particular
decision). The Administrator has full discretionary authority to exercise each of the foregoing powers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to an RSU Award, the authority to interpret and apply the terms of the Equity Plan and any applicable Award Agreement
(including the determination of the extent to which the foregoing provisions are applicable) reside in the person so authorized under the
Equity Plan’s terms.
        8.2.    Incapacity. If the Administrator determines that any Participant entitled to benefits under the Program is unable to care
for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due (unless a duly qualified guardian or other legal representative has
been appointed) may be paid for the benefit of such Participant to his or her spouse, parent, brother, sister, or other party deemed by
the Administrator to have incurred expenses for such Participant.
                                                                       8
---
        8.3.    Amendment, Suspension, and Termination. The Compensation Committee of the Board has the right by written
resolution to amend, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time, subject to the terms of this Section 8.3. After a Corporate
Transaction, no amendment, suspension, or termination that reduces the benefits to which a Participant is entitled under the Program
will apply to a Director who, at the time the amendment is adopted, already is a Participant without his or her express written consent.
Notwithstanding    the foregoing,  the  Compensation     Committee    of the  Board   may   amend   the  Program    at any  time  to the  extent
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, provided that, to the extent possible, such amendment does not reduce the
benefits of a Participant.
        8.4.    Power to Delegate Authority. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, delegate to any person or persons all or
part of its authority and responsibility under the Program.
        8.5.    Headings. The headings used in this document are for convenience of reference only and may not be given any weight
in interpreting any provision of the Program.
        8.6.    Severability. If an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that any term, provision, or portion of the
Program is void, illegal, or unenforceable, the other terms, provisions, and portions of the Program will remain in full force and effect,
and the terms, provisions, and portions that are determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable will either be limited so that they will
remain in effect to the extent permissible by law, or such arbitrator or court will substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar
thereto or other provisions, so as to provide to the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by
the Program.
        8.7.    Governing Law. The Program will be construed, administered, and regulated in accordance with the laws of California
(excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle), except to the extent that those laws are preempted by federal law.
        8.8.    Complete Statement of Program. The Program contains a complete statement of its terms. A Participant’s right to any
benefit  of a type  provided   under  the Program    will be determined    solely in accordance    with the  terms  of the  Program.   No  other
evidence,   whether   written or  oral, will be taken  into  account  in interpreting  the  provisions  of the  Program.   Notwithstanding   the
preceding provisions of this Section 8.8, for purposes of determining the RSU Award due to a Participant, the Program will be deemed
to include the applicable terms of the Equity Plan and any applicable Award Agreement.
        8.9.    Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The Program will be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a
manner that makes the Program and the benefits hereunder exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt,
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent Section 409A of the Code is applicable, (a) distributions shall only be made
in a manner and upon an event permitted under Section 409A of the Code, (b) payments to be made upon a termination of service
shall only be made upon a “separation from service” under Section 409A of the Code, (c) each installment payment shall be treated as
a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and (d) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate
the calendar year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. In no event will any Participant
have a right to payment or reimbursement or otherwise from the Company or its Affiliates, or
                                                                        9

                    fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
                    affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and
5.        The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
          registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
          (a)       All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
                    likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
          (b)       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control
                    over financial reporting.
