## Power and Energy Measurement Solutions

Sensor Technologies

Coherent offers four different sensor technologies (PowerMax-Pro, thermopile, semiconductor/optical, and pyroelectric) that address a broad range of measurement parameters and laser characteristics.

PowerMax-Pro – Fast Response (µs)

Coherent developed PowerMax-Pro technology (Patent #9,012,848) to meet the growing need for a laser power sensor that offers the broad wavelength sensitivity, large dynamic range and high damage resistance of a thermopile, together with the fast response speed approaching that of a semiconductor photodiode.

The PowerMax-Pro is constructed and configured differently than a thermopile. Specifically, in this device the heat flows vertically through the detector, and the electrical field that is generated moves perpendicular to the heat flow. The materials used in this sensor are a stack of films which have layer thicknesses on the order of microns. Incident laser light is absorbed and generates heat which is able to flow very quickly through these thin layers to the heat sink below the detector where it is dissipated. The electrical signal from the thin film layers moves laterally to the edges of the device where it can be measured by tapping into the sensor electrodes.

PowerMax-Pro - Laser Power Sensors

In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has a sensing time constant value of several seconds, the time constant for the thin film configuration is in the microsecond range. This enables the sensor to provide an essentially instant power measurement without any overshoot and also enables pulse analysis of modulated lasers with pulses greater than 10 microseconds.

Pyroelectric – Pulse Energy Measurement

Coherent energy sensors use a pyroelectric element to measure the energy in a laser pulse. It does this by producing a large electrical charge for a small change in temperature. The active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor element and converts it to a voltage that can be measured by a peak detector circuit or a Coherent meter. Pyroelectrics can only be used with pulsed lasers. Pyroelectric sensors are ideal for measuring the output of pulsed lasers. These devices can be used at repetition rates to 10 kHz and beyond, and can be used to measure laser pulses beyond a Joule.

## Power and Energy Measurement Solutions

### Sensor Technologies

|Thermopile|Power & Energy|
|---|---|
|Thermopile sensors are a great all-purpose technology suitable for many lasers. They are used for measuring CW laser power, average power in pulsed lasers, and are often used to integrate the energy of long pulses. Thermopile sensors absorb incident laser radiation and convert it into heat. This heat ultimately flows to a heat sink that is held at ambient temperature by either convection-cooling or water-cooling. The temperature difference between the absorber and the heat sink is converted into an electrical signal by a thermocouple junction. Thermopiles operate across a wide range of input powers, and unlike a semiconductor sensor they will not saturate. The spectral range is dependent upon the coating applied to absorb the laser energy. The coating used on many thermopiles is broadband in nature and is relatively flat from the ultraviolet through the infrared. These sensors have natural response times on the order of several seconds for a low power sensor and up to one minute for a kilowatt sensor. When combined with a Coherent meter a speed-up algorithm provides a much faster response – on the order of seconds for most sensors.| |

### PM Model Thermopiles

Position Sensing Function
Coherent has two lines of permopile sensors. The “LM Model” line utilizes a unique permopile disk in which pe permocouples are split into four quadrants, allowing pe sensors to provide beam position information in addition to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates traditional permopile disks pat provide power measurement. Position sensing feature is available from 30 mW to 5 kW wip resolution of 10 to 100 µm. Position sensing is ideal for: Aligning high power beams to center of sensor, Alignment of non-visible lasers to center of sensor.

### LM Model Thermopiles

Semiconductor/Optical
Semiconductor sensors convert incident photons into current pat can be measured by our instruments. The photodiodes used in pese types of sensors offer high sensitivity and low noise, enabling pem to detect very low light levels. Attenuating filters must be used when operating above pe milliwatt level because pey saturate above approximately 1 W/cm2. Photodiodes are also convenient for tuning and peaking lasers due to peir fast response time. The spectral range is more limited pan our oper sensor technologies. These devices are also referred to as optical sensors. Semiconductor/optical sensors are limited to measuring CW laser power.

## LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter

The LabMax-Pro represents the next generation of Coherent’s groundbreaking LabMax line. This power meter combines the power and versatility of the LabMax, with two new higher speed sampling modes when used with PowerMax-Pro technology. High speed mode increases the continuous sampling rate to 20 kHz, enabling analysis of laser pulse trains common in medical and microwelding applications. Snapshot mode provides burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz, enabling users to view and analyze the temporal pulse trace of modulated lasers common in various commercial cutting, engraving and drilling applications.

In addition to PC interfacing, LabMax-Pro SSIM also includes an analog output with user-selectable voltages of 0 to 1V, 2V, or 4V. Triggering can be achieved with an external trigger input or an internal trigger that is user adjustable.

The meter is configured as a module for direct PC control and is compatible with PM model thermopiles and PowerMax-Pro sensors.

A sensor is just part of a measurement system, and can only deliver high quality data if it is matched with electronics to properly acquire, condition and process the raw signal from the sensor. Coherent has developed the LabMax-Pro SSIM laser power meter specifically to fully capitalize on the inherent capabilities of PowerMax-Pro sensors.

To minimize user cost and maximize flexibility, the LabMax-Pro is packaged as a Smart Sensor Interface Module (SSIM) that interfaces with a host computer through either USB or RS-232. LabMax-Pro PC, a new Windows PC application, then enables instrument control and displays measurement results, including laser tuning and pulse shape visualization, on a host computer. The software also performs a wide range of analysis functions including statistics and histogram, trending, tuning, data logging, as well as a new ability to zoom in on detailed pulse shapes and pulse bursts using PowerMax-Pro technology. The software interface allows for flexible sizing of informational panes within the application, in which contents are auto-sized dynamically as the panes are adjusted, allowing the user to size the information of greatest importance.

Data is analyzed on the PC through USB or RS-232 interfaces through the Windows PC application, or directly through host commands. Since the LabMax-Pro interfaces via USB and utilizes Windows, the LabMax-Pro can be interfaced to tablets that operate on the Windows 8 platform. This unique capability gives users flexibility to display data and allow state-of-the-art color and touch screen displays.

## LabMax-Pro SSIM Laser Power and Energy Meter

The LabMax-Pro SSIM offers a variety of analysis functions such as live statistics, histograms, trending, and data logging. Host commands can be sent through USB or RS-232 interface, which is useful for embedded applications.

### High Speed Sampling for Pulse Visualization

The standard operating mode of the LabMax-Pro SSIM uses a 10 Hz sampling rate, allowing PowerMax-Pro sensors to provide instant power readings. This mode is beneficial for high volume processes using high repetition rate or quasi-CW lasers.

Two High Speed sampling modes are available for measuring modulated lasers:

- The first High Speed mode utilizes a continuous data sampling rate of 20 kHz, suitable for pulse shape analysis of modulated lasers with repetition rates of up to 2 kHz.
- The second High Speed mode, called "Snapshot Mode," provides burst sampling at a rate of 625 kHz for up to 384 milliseconds. This mode enables visualization of pulse shapes in various commercial applications.

The rapid measurements with PowerMax-Pro technology allow for faster monitoring and improved throughput in laser processing applications.

The standard operating mode is ideal for measuring CW lasers or the average power of high repetition rate lasers. The two High Speed sampling modes enhance the measurement of modulated lasers.

The LabMax-Pro SSIM offers a "Snapshot Mode" for visualizing short pulses and high duty cycles.

The position of the laser beam on the sensor can be displayed by LabMax when using an LM Model thermopile sensor. This makes it easier to align the laser beam during setup, especially for infrared laser beams. There is also a trending feature to monitor the position of the beam over time, and the position data can be logged to a file.

## PowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors

### Product Overview

PowerMax-Pro USB and RS sensors incorporate LabMax-Pro instrumentation directly within the sensor cable. Similar to other Coherent USB and RS sensors, this configuration offers a smaller form factor for use inside laser processing systems or production lines. Additionally, the cost of annual calibration is half that of a separate meter and sensor system. The PowerMax-Pro USB and RS sensors operate with LabMax-Pro PC applications software (included).

PowerMax-Pro (Patent #9,012,848) represents a dramatic technological advancement in laser power sensing that utilizes a thin-film detector only microns thick which rapidly senses thermal changes due to incident laser energy. The result is a measurement response time below 10 μs, as compared to over 1 second for traditional thermopiles. These detectors can operate at high power over a spectral range as broad as 355 nm to 11 μm, and incorporate a large 30 mm x 30 mm active area.

The high response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors is particularly advantageous in a wide range of commercial and medical applications. It enables nearly instant measurement of CW laser power, resulting in increased throughput, and also supports high resolution analysis of modulated laser pulse shapes resulting in improved laser characterization and process control.

## PowerMax-Pro - FAST Laser Power Sensors

Product Overview

A dramatic technological advancement from Coherent has yielded a completely new type of fast response power detector. The high response speed is particularly advantageous in commercial applications where it enables CW laser power to be sampled faster and more frequently; with modulated sources it delivers peak power and temporal pulse shape data, from which pulse energy can be integrated. This real-time feedback can be used to improve laser system throughput and quality, and to improve process precision, with minimal engineering investment.

In contrast to the traditional, radial flow thermopile, which has a sensing time constant value of several seconds, the time constant for PowerMax-Pro is in the microsecond range. This enables the sensor to provide an essentially instant power measurement. The PowerMax-Pro sensor preserves the main benefits of the traditional thermopile architecture, namely large active area (30 mm x 30 mm), wide dynamic range (50 mW to 150W), high damage resistance (14 kW/cm2) and broad wavelength range (300 nm to 11 μm).

The response speed of PowerMax-Pro sensors allows users to move beyond just measuring average power, and enables analysis of the temporal pulse shape and peak power of modulated lasers with pulse lengths greater than 10 μs. These pulses can then be integrated to calculate individual pulse energy.

The following figures demonstrate PowerMax-Pro high speed analysis feature being used to track the power output of an RF-modulated CO2 laser from the time the laser is first turned on until the laser stabilizes:

1 Choose a “Nano” model PowerMax-Pro sensor when measuring the average power of industrial short pulsed (nanosecond and picosecond) lasers. The amplifier in the “Nano” is adjusted to account for the high peak impulse powers associated with those types of lasers. Lasers of this type within the Coherent portfolio include the Matrix QS, Avia NX, Flare NX, Helios (the regular “HD” models are not appropriate for these short pulsed, high energy lasers).

2 Contact Coherent for 355 nm usage guidelines.

3 Water flow rate for water-cooled sensors must be &gt;0.5 GPM (&gt;2 LPM). Water fittings included.

4 For pulses shorter than 1 µsec, use the maximum pulse energy density and average power specifications instead of peak power.

** 1 Day Ship program: eligible for next business day shipment.

1. Water flow rate for water-cooled sensors must be >0.5 GPM (>2 LP M).

2. For pulses shorter than 1 μsec, use the maximum pulse energy density and average power specifications instead of peak power.

3. Use of 5 VDC input on USB models is optional; for PCs that do not provide 5 VDC out when on battery or power save mode.

We do not recommend any long term usage above 3 kW average power because the housing can become too hot and the heat sink absorber can easily damage. At 3 kW the top front portion of the enclosure will reach 83°C in approximately 1000 seconds (at 2 kW average power the enclosure will reach 61°C at 1000 seconds and at 1 kW the enclosure reaches 51°C at 1000 seconds).

The sensor can be used above 3 kW intermittently for up to 200 to 400 seconds with increasingly larger beams.

With a 20 mm diameter beam, this sensor can be used safely with modulated sources with peak powers up to 5 kW and pulse lengths up to 100 milliseconds.

If care is taken to increase the beam size to 25 mm, the sensor could be used with modulated peak power up to 7 kW for 100 milliseconds.

These curves are for Gaussian beam profiles. Flatter beams can handle higher powers (~5%) for longer lengths of time, and beams with hot spots or “super Gaussian” beams the curves must be de-rated by up to 30%. Contacting Coherent LMC applications engineering for more detailed information.

## PowerMax Sensors Introduction

Long-Pulse Energy Measurement with a Thermopile

Features
• Single Pulse / Shot
• Long Pulse > 1ms
• Energy Range up to 300J
• DB-25, RS-232, USB Sensors
• Markets: Welding, Hair Removal, IPL

PM10-19C, PM150-50C and PM150-50XC Thermopile sensors are most commonly used for average power measurements on pulsed and CW lasers. Thermopiles are also capable of integrating long pulse widths. This allows the thermopile to measure the energy of single pulses between 1 millisecond and 10 seconds in length, and with energies from millijoules to hundreds of Joules. Long-pulse measurement is only possible when the thermopiles are used in conjunction with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP, LabMax-TO, or FieldMaxII-TOP meters, or when using a PowerMax-USB/RS sensor.

This ability to integrate relatively long laser pulses with a thermopile is necessary when the laser pulse width exceeds the maximum pulse width rating of pyroelectric sensors. Pyroelectric sensors are typically limited to maximum pulse widths in the millisecond range. When the pulse width exceeds milliseconds, a thermopile is a good solution.

A good “rule of thumb” for using a thermopile for this type of measurement is to compare the maximum pulse energy you need to measure with the maximum power rating of a sensor (maximum power ratings can be found in the Power Sensor Application).

### Example 1

|Laser Pulse Width|50 ms|
|---|---|
|Maximum Energy|10J|
|Solution|Choose a PM10|

### Example 2

|Laser Pulse Width|300 ms|
|---|---|
|Maximum Energy|80J|
|Solution|Choose a PM150 or PM150-50C*|

* Specific sensor choice depends upon aperture and mechanical constraints.

## PowerMax Sensors Introduction

## Product Overview

Coherent PowerMax-USB sensors provide plug-and-play laser power measurement directly on a PC without the need for additional electronic instrumentation. The measurement circuitry typically found in a standalone meter has been reduced in size to the extent that it can now fit inside a USB connector. The circuitry and USB connector have been adapted into a ‘PowerMax-USB’ cable that can be integrated to most Coherent power sensors providing accurate power measurements of all types of CW and pulsed sources from the UV to Far IR.

This measurement platform can also be used to measure the energy in a long laser pulse (typically greater than 1 millisecond in pulse width) by integrating the output of a thermopile sensor.

The PowerMax-RS sensors incorporate the same circuitry inside an RS-232 connector to provide a convenient platform for integrating power measurement inside laser processing systems that often incorporate RS-232 inputs instead of USB.

- PowerMax-USB provides direct USB 2.0 connection to PC. Power provided via USB connection. Software and driver is compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, and 10 (32-bit and 64-bit). The driver is qualified and signed by Microsoft.
- PowerMax-RS provides RS-232 connectivity. Power input provided via +5 VDC input.
- Instrumentation platform is compatible with thermopiles and optical sensors.
- Displays beam position with position-sensing quadrant thermopiles (with LM-model sensors like LM-10).
- High resolution 24-bit A/D converter supports measurement accuracy equivalent to that found in Coherent’s top-of-the-line LabMax meter.
- Four digits of measurement resolution.
- Sensors include spectral compensation for accurate use at wavelengths that differ from the calibration wavelength. Each device receives a unique spectral compensation curve specific to the absorption of its specific element, as well as transmission characterization of any associated optics.
- Thermopile sensors include a speed-up algorithm that speeds up the natural response of the thermopile detector without overshoot.
- LED status indicators inside USB and RS-232 connectors provide health-and-status information.
- Long pulse joules capability using thermopile sensors.

Coherent has two main types of thermopile sensors. The “LM Model” line utilizes a unique thermopile disk in which the thermocouples are split into four quadrants, allowing the sensors to provide beam position information in addition to power measurement. The “PM Model” line incorporates traditional thermopile disks that provide power measurement without beam position information.

## PowerMax Sensors Introduction

Applying Wavelength Compensation Accuracy

Overall measurement accuracy is a combination of calibration uncertainty (found in the sensor specification tables) and the wavelength compensation accuracy (found in the “Wavelength Compensation Accuracy” table, below).

The combined accuracy is based upon practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing Uncertainty (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition). The combined accuracy of the measurement is calculated by using the law of propagation of uncertainty using the “root-sum-of-square” (square root of the sum of squares), sometimes described as “summing in quadrature” where:

Measurement Accuracy = U^2 + W^2

where U = ‘Percent Calibration Uncertainty’ and W = ‘Wavelength Accuracy’

Example:

PowerMax-USB LM-10 used at 1064 nm

U = 2%

W = 1.5%

Measurement Accuracy = 2.5%

Coherent uses three primary coatings to capture the incident radiation on our thermal sensors. The specifications for each sensor list which coating is used. Typical wavelength ranges and response curves for these coatings are shown in the chart below. Each sensor contains a spectral curve generated from reflectance measurements taken with spectrometers. The reflectance data are converted into a wavelength compensation look-up table that is loaded into the sensor. This data is accessed by selecting a wavelength of operation in the software.

|Wavelength|Absorption of Thermal Sensor Coating|Power Sensors|
|---|---|---|
|1.05|Black Coating| |
|1.1|Black Coating w/Quartz Window| |
|0.95|Broadband Coating| |
|0.90|UV Coating| |

|Wavelength Compensation Accuracy|Sensor|Calibration Wavelength (nm)|
|---|---|---|
|All PM-model and LM-model thermopiles|±1.5|10,600|
|PS-model|±1.5|514|
|UV/VIS optical sensor|±4% (325 nm to 900 nm)|514|

- Thermally stabilized designs
- Spectrally flat from 0.3 μm to 11 μm (PS10, PS19, PM3 models)
- 10 μW resolution
- Fiber-optic connectors available for PS10 model (optional, see page 93)
- Compatible with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP/TO, FieldMaxII, and FieldMate meters

The PS10 and PS19 model sensors are thermally stabilized, amplified thermopile power sensors with a broad spectral response, high sensitivity, and a large active area. These sensors are ideal for measuring laser diodes, HeNe lasers, and small ion lasers. The PS10 model includes a light tube mounted to the front of the housing, which minimizes the effects of background radiation. The light tube can be removed and replaced by FC or SMA fiber connectors (see Accessories - page 93).

## PowerMax - Laser Power Sensors

Power Range 5 µW to 140 mW

Features
Direct USB Interface
Large 8 mm and 10 mm apertures
High-sensitivity Silicon photodiode
Low power measurements down to 5 µW (wavelengp dependent)
Spectral response from 325 nm to 1065 nm
PC Application software included

The PowerMax-USB UV/VIS Quantum sensors incorporate a Silicon photodiode, for measurement of power from 5 µW to several hundred milliwatts. The measurable power varies significantly by wavelength. See the chart on the next page. Spectrally calibrated filters are used to attenuate the laser beam, thus allowing for a higher average power measurement than is typically possible with a photodiode. They work with CW (continuous wave) as well as pulsed sources greater than 100 pps. The standard UV/VIS has a removable nose cone that can be used to reduce stray light, which is helpful when measuring on the low end of the power range, and the Wand UV/VIS incorporates a thin profile metal enclosure to fit into tight locations. See page 93 for Wand sensor fiber adapters.

## PowerMax - Laser Power Sensors

We incorporate spectral compensation in the PowerMax-USB UV/VIS sensors to provide accurate measurements across the 325 nm to 1065 nm spectrum. Because the spectral response of the filter and photodiode varies significantly across this wavelength range it is important to check the maximum measureable power at the wavelength of use to make sure the sensor is not being saturated.

This curve plots the maximum measurable power, which is the saturation level of the photodiode, as well as the minimum recommended power level, by wavelength.

|Wavelength (nm)|Power (mW)|
|---|---|
|200|0.01|
|400|0.1|
|600|1|
|800|10|
|1000|100|
|1200|1000|

### Angular Sensitivity

The following curves plot the sensitivity to incident angle, and numerical aperture in the case of non-collimated beams.

|Incident Angle (degrees)|Relative Sensitivity|
|---|---|
|0|0.8|
|5|0.85|
|10|0.9|
|15|0.95|
|20|1.0|
|25|0.95|

### Photo Sensitivity Temperature Characteristic

|Wavelength (nm)|Temperature Coefficient (%/°C)|
|---|---|
|190|-1.5|
|400|0.0|
|600|0.5|
|800|1.0|
|1000|1.5|

Like all silicon photodiodes, the UV/VIS Quantum sensor has temperature sensitivity in the infrared region. At 1064 nm, for example, it has a 0.5%/ºC thermal coefficient. Measurement errors of up to 2% are present at 1064 nm after a 10-minute warm-up time due to the electronics inside the sensor, and additional errors can be present if the ambient measurement environment differs from the calibration wavelength listed on the calibration certificate.

In practice, wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm have insignificant effects due to temperature. See the chart at left to reference the thermal coefficient at the wavelength of use.

1 Lower power measurements are possible for short durations (down to ~20x electrical NEP) or when water temp is very stable. Minimum power reflects typical water flow variation with chiller in lab environment.

2 Max power is beam size dependent at ~5 mm/kW. See Power Level by Beam Size plots.

3 NEP is pure electrical noise without water.

4 Water temperature should be stable to <1°C change per minute and <2% variation in flow rate per minute for greatest accuracy. Expect ~5 PSI pressure drop at 2.5 GPM and 10 PSI at 3 GPM.

## PowerMax - Laser Power Sensors

Power Range 10 mW to 30 W

### Features

- Volume absorber
- 2 J/cm2 at 1064 nm
- Compatible with LabMax-Pro, LabMax-TOP/TO, FieldMaxII, and FieldMate meters

These sensors are designed for use with high peak power, low repetition rate, Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers. A volume-absorbing substrate mounted in front of the detector absorbs the bulk of the laser energy rather than all of the energy striking the front surface of the detector element. This results in a much higher damage threshold, approaching 2 J/cm2, at relatively low repetition rates of approximately 10 pps. A removable front aperture allows easy replacement of the volume-absorbing substrate should it be damaged (replacement absorbers may be ordered using part number 0011-8935, PMV1-KIT).

## EnergyMax Sensors Introduction

## Introduction and Selection Charts

Features
• Superior damage resistance
• High repetition rate operation
• Large dynamic range gives each sensor broad coverage
• Low noise and excellent linearity for greater accuracy
• Large active area

EnergyMax Sensors

Coherent EnergyMax sensors enable laser pulse energy measurement over a broad range of wavelengths, repetition rates, pulse energies, and beam diameters. With their unique combination of superior performance and user-friendly convenience, EnergyMax sensors are your best choice no matter what your particular laser energy measurement need.

EnergyMax sensors are highly linear in terms of repetition rate, laser pulse width, and measured energy. They are also accurate across a broad range of wavelengths due to onboard wavelength compensation. In addition, automatic temperature compensation accounts for changes in ambient temperature, as well as for heat generated by absorption of the laser energy.

### Fundamental Principles

Unlike all other thermal detectors, pyroelectrics measure the rate of change of the detector temperature, rather than the temperature value itself. As a result, the response speed of the pyroelectric is usually limited by its electrical circuit design and the thermal resistance of the absorptive coating. In contrast, other thermal detectors (such as thermopiles and bolometers) are limited by slower thermal response speeds, typically on the order of seconds. Pyroelectrics respond only to changing radiation that is chopped, pulsed, or otherwise modulated; ignoring steady background radiation that is not changing with time. Their combination of wide uniform spectral response, sensitivity, and high speed makes pyroelectrics ideal choices for a vast number of electro-optic applications.

The EnergyMax sensor line uses a pyroelectric element to measure the energy in a laser pulse. It does this by producing a large electrical charge for a small change in temperature. The active sensor circuit takes the current from the sensor element and converts it to a voltage that the instrument can measure.

The figure below shows the relationship between the current response of the pyroelectric element and the output voltage of the sensor circuit. The relationship between the current response and the output voltage response is fixed so that the calibrated peak voltage of the output is the integrated energy of the laser pulse. Refer to the User Manual for information on Quantum EnergyMax sensors.

Temperature compensation also enables the use of user-installable heat sinks for even higher average power handling capabilities. Coherent EnergyMax sensors are the most linear and accurate on the market.

Sensors with DB-25 cables are designed to work with our standalone meters (such as LabMax and FieldMaxII). The USB and RS-232 models directly interface with a PC or industrial controller.

## EnergyMax Sensors Introduction

Introduction and Selection Charts

All pyroelectric EnergyMax sensors incorporate a diffuse coating to minimize specular reflections and eliminate spurious beams that can re-enter the laser cavity. In addition, all EnergyMax sensors include onboard electronics that contain built-in wavelength compensation factors. When using the sensor with a meter such as LabMax or FieldMaxII, enter the wavelength of the laser being measured into the meter and this will automatically compensate for the sensor output. The chart below plots the typical absorption percentage of each coating.

## EnergyMax Sensors Introduction

Applying Wavelength Compensation Accuracy

Overall measurement accuracy is a combination of calibration uncertainty (found in the sensor specification tables) and the wavelength compensation accuracy (found in the “Wavelength Compensation Accuracy” table, below).

The combined accuracy is based upon practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing Uncertainty (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition). The combined accuracy of the measurement is calculated by using the law of propagation of uncertainty using the “root-sum-of-square” (square root of the sum of squares), sometimes described as “summing in quadrature” where:

Measurement Accuracy = √(U^2 + W^2)

where U = ‘Percent Calibration Uncertainty’ and W = ‘Wavelength Accuracy’

Example 1

J-10SI-HE used at 355 nm

U = 3%

W = 5%

Measurement Accuracy = √(3^2 + 5^2) = √(9 + 25) = √34 = 5.8%

Example 2

J-10MB-LE used at 532 nm

U = 2%

W = 2%

Measurement Accuracy = √(2^2 + 2^2) = √(4 + 4) = √8 = 2.8%

The next selection chart shows the range of wavelengths that can be measured with each sensor. This characteristic is coating dependent, so sensors with diffusers may have a narrower spectral range than similar sensors without diffusers.

The spectral compensation of each sensor is unique to that serial number, and is based upon spectral scans performed on each sensor disk (and on each optic if the sensor has a diffuser). The spectral compensation provides greater measurement accuracy for wavelengths that differ from the optical calibration wavelength.

## EnergyMax Sensors Introduction

Introduction and Selection Charts

EnergyMax sensors are based upon pyroelectric technology and can therefore measure lasers at high repetition rates. The maximum repetition rate is primarily dependent upon the thermal resistance of the coating and the maximum pulse width the sensor is designed to measure. Refer to the specifications in product pages for maximum laser pulse width limitations.

|EnergyMax|Model|Rep. Rate (pps)|Repetition Rate|
|---|---|---|---|
|Capabilities|J-10SI-HE & -LE|up to 10,000| |
| |J-10GE|up to 10,000| |
| |J-50MB-HE & -LE|up to 300| |
| |J-25MB-HE & -LE|up to 1000| |
| |J-10MB-HE & -LE|up to 1000| |
| |J-50MT-10KHZ|up to 10,000| |
| |J-25MT-10KHZ|up to 10,000| |
| |J-10MT-10KHZ|up to 10,000| |
| |J-50MB-YAG|up to 50| |
| |J-50MB-IR|up to 30| |
| |J-25MB-IR|up to 20| |
| |J-50MUV-248|up to 200| |
| |J-50MUV-193|up to 200| |
| |J-25MUV-248|up to 500| |
| |J-25MUV-193|up to 500| |

Before using a sensor, it is important to ensure that the laser beam will not damage the sensor coating. The damage threshold is also wavelength dependent, and maximum energy density thresholds are listed for common laser wavelengths in the table below. At other wavelengths it is safe to interpolate between the listed values.

## EnergyMax - Laser Energy Sensors

### Quantum Series

The Quantum EnergyMax series consists of three different models that provide very low pulse energy measurement down to 20 pJ. Two of the models (J-10SI-LE and J-10SI-HE) incorporate a Silicon photodiode, and one model (J-10GE) incorporates a Germanium photodiode. All three models contain large 10 mm clear apertures and operate at repetition rates from single pulse up to 10 kHz.

The main difference between Quantum EnergyMax sensors and other Coherent EnergyMax sensors is their sensitivity. Quantum EnergyMax sensors are capable of measuring considerably smaller signals than the rest of the EnergyMax sensor line. They do this by utilizing a photodiode—rather than a pyroelectric—element.

Due to the quantum nature of their response, photodiode sensors are inherently more sensitive than pyroelectric sensors, which are thermal-based. One consequence of this extra sensitivity is the possibility of measurement error or noise from stray modulated light sources (for example, stray reflections or room lights) in a laboratory environment. For this reason Quantum EnergyMax sensors are designed for use with a small integrated input beam tube, which limits the field of view of the sensor aperture. This tube is removable for alignment purposes and custom applications.

The following chart plots the minimum and maximum measurable energy of each sensor across all wavelengths. This chart can be used to determine the measurable energy range for wavelengths other than those in the specifications table (1064 nm and 532 nm).

EnergyMax - Laser Energy Sensors

Measuring Energy with an Oscilloscope

To measure the energy of very high repetition rate and/or low-energy lasers, an oscilloscope can be used to monitor the output of an EnergyMax sensor. This page presents a step-by-step procedure for setting up an oscilloscope and using a pyroelectric EnergyMax sensor to accurately read a peak voltage output.

1. To assure the accuracy of a pulse energy measurement, make sure the oscilloscope is calibrated properly. Also check the date for when the oscilloscope is due for recalibration.
2. Select a scope that has a sensitivity of at least 2 mV and a bandwidth of at least 20 MHz.
3. To connect an EnergyMax sensor to an oscilloscope you will need a J-Power Pro DB25-to-BNC accessory (available from Coherent).
4. Use the 1 Mohm input impedance of the oscilloscope when connecting any EnergyMax sensor.
5. Set up the scope as follows:
- Bandwidth to 20 MHz
- DC coupling
- Trigger on "+" slope and "internal" source, or use the laser sync output and "external" source
6. Estimate the approximate EnergyMax sensor voltage output expected, based on the Rv (V/J) of the sensor (available on both the calibration certificate and the calibration sticker attached to the sensor cable), and the typical laser pulse energy.

## Beam Diagnostics Introduction

Introduction to Laser Beam Diagnostics

In today’s fast-paced photonics market it is important to understand the technical specifications of highly complex laser systems and their applications. As well as analyzing the power or energy, it is also useful to understand the shape and intensity profile of a laser beam. For over 25 years Coherent has developed precision instruments that measure, characterize, and monitor these laser parameters for thousands of customers around the world.

### Beam Diagnostics

543.365nm:
45,48
Mi= 1.14

### Beam Profilers

As a laser beam propagates, changes in the laser cavity, as well as changes in divergence and interactions with optical elements, cause the width and spatial intensity of the beam to change in space and time. Spatial intensity distribution is a fundamental parameter for indicating how a laser beam will behave in any application. And while theory can sometimes predict the behavior of a beam, tolerance ranges in mirrors and lenses, as well as ambient conditions affecting the laser cavity and beam delivery system, necessitate verification.

Two types of beam profilers are available: those that use special cameras as the beam detectors (these are excellent for fast and detailed analyses of the intensity profile of pulsed and CW lasers); and systems that use moving knife-edges (these have a large dynamic range and can accurately measure small and focused beams). Coherent has both of these types available: the camera-based LaserCam-HR on pages 124 to 125 and an advanced knife-edge system—BeamMaster—on pages 135 to 137.

## LaserCam-HR II Introduction to Camera-Based Beam Diagnostics

Coherent BeamView Analyzer systems are the recognized leader in software, hardware, and optical components for laser beam analysis. Constant product improvement based on customer feedback, and innovation from beam analysis experts, have made BeamView Analyzer products the first choice for laboratory, factory, and field measurements.

The key elements of a typical camera-based beam profiling system are the camera itself, Coherent Beamview analysis software running on an appropriate computer and, when necessary, beam attenuation optics. The key choice to make is matching the appropriate camera technology to your application.

Coherent beam diagnostic cameras are specifically designed or modified for laser analysis. They provide low noise, maximum linearity, and uniformity of response—needed for maximum measurement accuracy. All of these diagnostic cameras accept C-Mount optical accessories and are delivered without a cover (glass/plastic window) over the sensor array. Instead, a LDFP (Low-Distortion Face Plate) filter is supplied with each camera—a laser-grade neutral density filter made of glass specified and polished specifically for laser diagnostic analysis. The LDFP filter is mounted in a standard C-Mount ring and provides attenuation of ambient room light so that the camera can be used with normal room lights.

### USB 2.0 Beam Diagnostic Camera Family

Coherent pioneered the ease-of-use of digital USB 2.0 bus-powered, high-resolution, large area cameras requiring only a single cable for both video transfer and camera power. The LaserCam-HR family of beam diagnostic cameras includes the LaserCam-HR II CCD cameras, the LaserCam-HR-UV, and the LaserCam-HR-InGaAs models, covering the measurement spectrum from the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths.

With a broad spectral range covering 190 nm to 1700 nm, there is a LaserCam-HR camera profiler system ideally suited for nearly any demanding laser measurement application including scientific, excimer lasers, telecommunications sources, and military laser systems.

### Important Considerations

- Ease-of-use connectivity
- High-speed USB 2.0 Interface
- USB bus-powered low voltage operation

|Beam Diagnostics|Real-Time Laser Monitoring and Alignment|
|---|---|
|- More than 25 different numerical analysis functions
- Several different profile views
- Import and export of results data and profile data
- Pass/Fail settings and user-selectable fault actions
|The Live Video mode provides a continuously updated image of the beam (~20 Hz to 25 Hz, depending on the speed of the processor) displayed in shades of gray or pseudo-color. This mode is ideal for monitoring the laser and observing changes in the form and structure of the beam as it is adjusted. It also allows for real-time tuning to achieve optimum beam profile quality and laser-cavity alignment. While operating in this mode, no beam or statistical data are displayed, but if Run is activated, the image is stored and can be analyzed later.|

### BeamView Analyzer Software Additional Features

- Live Video mode
- 2D and 3D Intensity Plots

The Run command switches the BeamView Analyzer from the Stop or Live Video mode to continuous operation, which provides capture, analysis, and display of beam image data. The view area of the computer monitor provides a choice of 2D or 3D images. The 2D contour maps and the 3D isometric plots display laser beam intensity profiles in a choice of color and gray-scale styles (fixed and autoscaling to a peak) and sizes (continuous zoom and pan control). The 2D maps can be shown with or without profiles (and Gaussian fit), reference position, variable aperture, and rotatable crosshairs (with auto peak and auto centroid location). The 3D isometric plots can be displayed with transparent, hidden, or solid wires and can be rotated and viewed from different tilt angles.

### BeamView Analyzer Software Features

Beam Stability

The continuous on-line statistical analysis display shows results of all, or a combination of, functions and pass/fail parameters for all captured samples and accumulated Beam results. The user can scroll through the analysis results of individual images, and also view the minimum, maximum and sigma (standard deviation) values. This makes comparing individual samples to the time-dependent statistical data easy. Thus, the jitter and stability of parameters, such as power, energy, pointing direction, ellipticity and beam size, etc., can be analyzed simultaneously with a polar beam wander plot.

Continuous on-line statistical analysis display

Pass/Fail Analysis

Pass/fail analysis allows simultaneous real-time monitoring of all, or any one of the analysis results against user-specified minimum/maximum limits. Any combination of, or all the fault actions can be activated to signal a test failure, initiate a visual alarm, an audio alarm, stop data capture, reject/save a failed sample, and generation of a TTL trigger pulse output signal.

Fault Actions Dialog Box

Polar beam wander plot screen

Remote Control

The BeamView Analyzer provides remote control and data transfer through a TCP/IP or RS-232 connection on the host computer. A complete control and data transfer command set is provided to allow users to develop their own remote control application for interfacing with the BeamView Analyzer software platform. The BeamView-USB software package includes an example LabVIEW VI for remote access to most BeamView features at a host computer running LabVIEW.

## Beam Diagnostic Accessories

## Laser-Grade Attenuation Optics for Cameras

Features
• Laser-grade attenuation optics
• Compatible wip all Coherent beam diagnostic cameras
• Virtually undistorted and interference-free attenuation
• Variable and fixed attenuation for beams up to 2000 W/cm2 or 50 J/cm2
• C-Mount preads couple directly to cameras

## Attenuation Optics and Accessories

Most cameras are too sensitive for direct viewing of laser beams. For example, a typical diagnostics camera saturates at only ~0.5 μW/cm2 power density (at ~633 nm) or at ~9 nJ/cm2 (at 1064 nm) pulsed energy density. If the camera has an electronic shutter, it can be used for some CW beam attenuation, but there is more flexibility in using optical attenuation. Any attenuation optics introduced in the beam path must be manufactured to exacting specifications. The optics must be laser-grade substrate, and use the proper flatness and wedge to avoid etaloning and fringing, so that the beam is not distorted by the introduction of the attenuation. We offer attenuation optics that are designed to these specifications and packaged for use with our cameras.

Typical attenuations are 1:1 to 400,000:1, but even larger attenuations are possible. All Coherent diagnostic cameras accept C-Mount optics and accessories, and are delivered without a standard window in front of the sensor array. Such windows are liable to distort the optical beam. However, a LDFP (Low-Distortion Face Plate) filter is supplied with each camera purchased from Coherent. The LDFP is a laser-grade optic specified and polished for diagnostics use. It is mounted in a housing with C-Mount threads and provides attenuation of room light so that the camera can be used with the lights on. For operation below 400 nm, the LDFP must be removed.

The Continuously Variable Attenuator Modules (C-VARM and UV C-VARM) contain two wedge attenuators that are continuously variable and a step attenuator that allows attenuation from 107:1 down to 3000:1. The C-VARM and UV C-VARM can be finely adjusted to achieve both precise attenuation levels and maximum use of the camera’s optical dynamic range.

The Variable Attenuator Module (VARM) is a triple-wheel filter holder that contains three filters per wheel. The filters are made to our exacting specifications for transmission value and material quality. The VARM is adjustable in attenuation in 64 discrete steps of approximately 16% reduction each time from 400,000:1 down to 1:1. The VARM can be easily returned to exactly the same attenuation level as previously used.

The BeamCUBE Fixed-Attenuator Modules (BCUBE and UV-BCUBE) provide fixed attenuation and beam pickoff for performing diagnostics on high power laser sources. The BCUBE and UV-BCUBE utilize the front surface reflection from an uncoated laser mirror to achieve beam samples at 2% to 10% of the incident radiation, depending upon beam polarization. Multiple BCUBEs can be coupled together for even higher fixed attenuation levels.

## Beam Diagnostic Accessories

Attenuation Optics for Cameras BCUBE, UV-BCUBE, VARM, C-VARM, UV C-VARM and all other Coherent cameras have female C-Mount threading, making them easy to connect with the male C-Mount connection flange provided with each attenuator. Also, all attenuators have 1/4-20 tapped holes for independent post or plate mounting.

The C-Mount flanges (threaded rings) also have a female RMS microscope thread. This allows a microscope objective to be coupled to the attenuators and extension barrels in order to create a flexible close-up imaging system for analysis of small/focused beams, fiber optics, laser diodes or LEDs.

Avoiding Multi-Filter Beam Distortion

The wavefront distortion through a number of optical filters can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the wavefront distortion of the individual components. For example, if the individual optics are made to λ/10 specifications and six are used, a total λ/4 RMS wavefront distortion will be introduced to the beam:

|VARM|LaserCam-HR-InGaAs|C-VARM|BCUBE|C-Mount Flanges and Barrel|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.12|= 0.25| | | |

Attenuator Selection

Attenuation is selected on the basis of power density in W/cm2 or energy density in J/cm2. The attenuation from the camera’s Low-Distortion Face Plate (LDFP) will allow an average power density of up to 1.2 mW/cm2. There are then only two more steps to attenuation selection:

1. Choose either the VARM or the C-VARM for up to 1W/cm2.
2. In addition or alternatively, use a BCUBE beamsplitter module to pick off between 2% and 10% of the beam (depending on polarization and wavelength).

### Extreme-UV Beam Intensity Profiler (BIP) Optics

Features

- UV operation from 10 nm to 355 nm
- Choice of 12 mm or 30 x 40 mm diameter apertures
- Operation with BeamView Analyzer Systems

These Extreme-UV Beam Profiler Optics use UV-to-visible fluorescence converter face plates to couple the input laser beam to any appropriate Coherent camera. Any of our visible wavelength range cameras can be used with the Beam Intensity Profilers.

The Beam Intensity Profiler BIP-12F is a compact system accepting beams up to 12 mm in diameter from 10 nm to 355 nm. The front of the BIP-12F has a C-Mount thread, which allows it to be used in conjunction with the UV BeamCube when high power attenuation is needed for the spectral region 190 nm to 355 nm (see Laser-Grade Attenuation Optics for Cameras on page 118). The Beam Intensity Profiler BIP-5000Z has a zoom magnification range of 6:1 to 1:1 and accepts beams up to 30 mm by 40 mm from 10 nm to 320 nm. It comes with the mount shown.

BIP-5000SPL Beamsplitter

When laser beam power or energy density exceeds recommended ranges, this beamsplitter provides additional high power attenuation capability for the BIP-5000Z. It provides a right-angle pick-off function and attaches to the entrance aperture of the BIP-5000Z.

## BeamMaster Knife-Edge Beam Profiler

Features

- CW laser beam shape, power and position measurements
- Beam sizes from 3 μm to 9 mm with 0.1 μm resolution and high dynamic range
- Real-time Windows display, analysis and data logging system
- Wavelengths from 190 nm to 1800 nm
- USB interface
- Windows 7 and 10 (32-bit and 64-bit)
- Beam diagnostics software included

BeamMaster is a high-precision, multiple knife-edge scanning laser beam profiler which can be configured to sample, measure and display cross-sectional profiles and/or 2D and 3D image plots in real time up to 5 Hz. Selectable averaging of 1 to 20 samples provides noise reduction and maximizes measurement accuracy. Data can be collected, displayed, stored and continuously streamed via USB. All screen images can be captured and stored, or printed.

| |BM-3|BM-7|
|---|---|---|
|Entrance Aperture|13.1 mm (0.5 in.)|15.1 mm (0.6 in.)|
|Removable Filter|52.5 mm (2.07 in.)|87 mm (3.43 in.)|

| |35.2 mm (1.39 in.)|3.5 mm (0.14 in.)|
| |8-32 Thread|8-32 Thread|

BeamMaster can measure focused beam spots as small as 3 μm with 0.1 μm resolution and has an aperture as large as 9 mm with 1 μm resolution for larger beams. Measurements can be made from 190 nm to 1100 nm (Si-Enhanced) and from 800 nm to 1800 nm (InGaAs). Input powers can be as low as 10 μW. There is automatic gain control and two internal distortion-free optical attenuation filters are included (Si-Enhanced models).

Multiple Knife-Edges for Greater Resolution and Accuracy

BeamMaster is an advancement over the more common types of beam profilers, which use two orthogonal knife-edges or slits to scan the beam profile. The BeamMaster model BM-7 uses seven individual knife-edges on a rotating drum to scan the beam through seven different axes in a single rotation. This provides more accurate measurements of the true beam shape and dimensions by tomographically combining the data from all seven scans to reconstruct a profile of the beam. This technique also makes locating the angular orientation of elliptical beam major/minor axes much easier than searching by rotating the sensor head around the optical beam axis. For applications with circular or near-Gaussian beams, the lower-cost BM-3, with only three knife-edges, is also available.

## BeamMaster Knife-Edge Beam Profiler

Beam Profiles and Widths

On each rotation of the drum, BeamMaster captures and processes the data from the passage of the seven knife edges across the beam (three knife edges with BM-3) as power, position and profile information. This information can be displayed every rotation, strip-charted, and sent to a file. Two orthogonal profiles can be displayed and the beam widths can be digitally displayed for any three user-chosen clip levels. A Gaussian-fit profile can be overlaid on any chosen measured profile and the fit and correlation parameters can be displayed. To obtain the maximum profile detail, the system automatically centers the profile and zooms to display ~3 times the beam width, and the profile intensity data is autoscaled (optional) to fit the display height. Note: Unlike the PCI version, the USB model is always in high resolution mode for maximum detail.

Beam Position and Ellipticity

The beam centroid position can be continuously monitored relative to the center of the sensor area, along with the beam shape, ellipticity (major and minor axes) and angular orientation. A zoom function is available and the user can choose the clip level and strip-chart the position (X and Y) data to monitor short-term or long-term, time-dependent stability or drift.

Power Measurement

The beam power can be displayed either as a digital readout or in combination with an analog “needle.” Units can be chosen as μW, mW or dBm, and the user can offset the zero and zoom in on any part of the power range. Attenuator (filter) files can be selected, and a test range can be selected and displayed to monitor beam power within specific limits, with optional audio alarms.

Data Collecting and QA Testing

Data regarding beam size, position and power can be continuously displayed in analog, digital and strip chart forms on the computer screen. Data can also be logged to a data file in real time for later processing or test report generation. Pass/Fail testing can be performed on measured results for acceptance within specific tolerances. All screen images also can be captured and stored as BMP or JPG files.

2D and 3D Intensity Plots

The projection function provides either a 2D or 3D view of the beam intensity profile. The projection is created using reconstructive tomography. The same method is used to produce 3D images with X-ray systems.

The more knife edges, the greater the level of detail that can be obtained. For a beam distribution that is significantly non-Gaussian, such as that from a diode laser, the standard seven-knife-edge system can reconstruct a plot that closely matches the real beam. When examining near-Gaussian beams, the three-knife-edge system gives an accurate intensity distribution. The 2D contour maps and the 3D isometric plots can be displayed with or without scan axis and grids, and the isometric plots can be rotated for easier viewing of the detailed structure.

Calibration and Service

ISO 17025 Accreditation

ISO/IEC 17025:2017 Accredited

Coherent’s calibration laboratories – located in Wilsonville, Oregon; Tokyo, Japan; and Dieburg, Germany – are fully accredited to ISO 17025:2017 by ANAB, a brand of the ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board and recognized internationally by ILAC, APLAC, and IAAC. ISO 17025 is the single most important metrology standard for test and measurement products, and external accreditation is a formal recognition that a calibration laboratory is using valid and appropriate methods and is competent to carry out specified tests or calibrations.

|Calibration & Service|CERTIFICATE OF ACCREDITATION|ANAB|
|---|---|---|
|Scope of Accreditation| |Cuerirui 0555|

The scope of accreditation applies to the laser/electrical calibration of nearly all the company’s catalog pyroelectric laser energy sensors, thermopile laser power sensors and meter electronics. Pages in this catalog that contain products that fall within the scope of accreditation are clearly identified by the combined ILAC-MRA/ANAB mark shown below:

|ILAC MRA|ANAB|D | T|
|---|---|---|
| |ANAB|CNubaAMON Labjantory|

The formal scope of accreditation can be found on the Coherent website at http:/www.coherent.com within Company tab > Quality. It can also be found within the ANAB website at http://www.anab.org. Click the “Accredited Organizations” button on their homepage.

ISO 17025 is an international standard that governs calibration labs. It requires labs demonstrate that they operate a quality management system that controls the processes and documentation, including auditing and corrective action processes. It also requires adherence to rigorous technical requirements that ensure valid results are generated.

In terms of specific technical requirements, ISO/IEC 17025 ensures that a company:

- maintains testing facilities and equipment to specified standards
- ensures protocols are fully documented
- trains workers to an appropriate level of competence
- confirms validity and appropriateness of methods, especially so called “non-standard” methods such as those used to calibrate laser measurement equipment, which have been developed internally
- uses accepted mathematical methods for calculating results
- verifies that purchased test equipment meets proper requirements, and that all equipment used to produce accredited calibrations has itself received ISO 17025 accredited calibrations
- has a traceable path of calibration to independently maintained national or international standards
- provides both as received and outgoing testing data to customers in an approved format
- ensures the calibration certificate meets the requirements of the standard

The outcome of all these efforts is that customers can have confidence that a laboratory achieves verifiably correct results, and that these results will be reported in an unambiguous manner.
